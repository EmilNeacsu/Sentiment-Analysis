1nl22x7,post,champions league,soccer,mg10pp,"[OC] Personal analysis of all the controversial Ballon D'Or podiums, plus a recap of the award's history and rules","The Ballon D'Or started being awarded in 1956 by the French magazine ""France Football"", responsible of selecting both the shortlist of candidates and the football journalists in charge of voting, which are one from each country and went from the initial few dozens just from Europe to almost 200 from all over the world in the most recent years

The journalists have to vote for their personal top 3 or top 5 players of the year (more recently it even went up to 10), who then receive an assigned number of points depending on their position

A very big flaw of the award is the fact that until 1995 non-European players couldn't be nominated, therefore not allowing to partecipate players of the caliber of Pelè, Maradona, Zico and others (I've made a little analysis about it in the comments)

Another minor problem is that over time and depending on the cases the award basically went from annual to seasonal, until this finally became official in 2022

Now a quick review of all the podiums:

**1956**

1. Matthews  
2. Di Stefano  
3. Kopa  

Not a good start, Matthews won by just 3 points and while it was mostly an award to his incredible career there were still some complaints considering the excellent second placed (Di Stefano was Argentinian but was still eligible since he also had the Spanish citizenship)

**1957**  

1. Di Stefano  
2. Billy Wright  
3. Duncan Edwards/Kopa (same number of points)  

**1958**  

1. Kopa  
2. Helmut Rahn  
3. Fontaine  

This was a World Cup year but after winning the third Champions League in a row and being once again the best player of the team Di Stefano should have been at minimum in the top three and probably first, but unfortunately he wasn't eligible for the shortlist since he had already won in the previous year, a rule which was then immediately scrapped. In any case it should be noted this was also the year in which a 17 years old Pelè scored 75 goals, a new world record and his personal best, of which 6 in the World Cup all between quarters, semis and final

**1959**  

1. Di Stefano  
2. Kopa  
3. John Charles  

**1960**  

1. Suarez  
2. Puskas  
3. Seeler  

Suarez was great, but Puskas had probably the best season of his career and should have definitely won (47 goals in the season, won the CL while being the top scorer and with 4 goals in the final). Special mention aslo for Seeler arriving third over Di Stefano despite playing only in the league, thanks to his incredible 49 goals scored in 33 matches in the Bundesliga predecessor

**1961**  

1. Sivori   
2. Suarez  
3. Johnny Haynes  

Sivori was Argentinian but also had the Italian citizenship which made him eligible

**1962**  

1. Masopust  
2. Eusebio  
3. Schnellinger 

It's true that Czechoslovakia arrived in final of the World Cup and Masopust was the second best player of the tournament after Garrincha, but considering his anonymous club season in a minor league I think Eusebio could have been another good choice after winning the Champions League and being the best player of his team, even if not scoring as much as he will do in the following seasons

**1963**  

1. Yashin  
2. Rivera  
3. Jimmy Greaves  

Lev Yashin was the first and also last goalkeeper to win the award, and when he gets called the best ever in his position it's especially thanks to his Ballon D'or. But it should be noted however that this was one of the (many) years where the world best player was actually Pelè

**1964**  

1. Denis Law  
2. Suarez  
3. Amancio  

Law scored over 40 goals during the season which was surely impressive, but Suarez dominated the midfield all year and was the main architect of Inter's victory in Champions League and also Spain's one in the Euros, and I think he should have won

**1965**  

1. Eusebio  
2. Facchetti  
3. Suarez  

**1966**  

1. Charlton  
2. Eusebio  
3. Beckenbauer  

Charlton was great and won the World Cup with England, but Eusebio was at just 1 point from him after the never repeated achievement of being the top scorer in the league, in Champions League and also at the World Cup, and I think he could have easily been first

**1967**  

1. Florian Albert  
2. Charlton  
3. Jimmy Johnstone

Nowadays it's a mostly forgotten name, but the Hungarian forward deserved his award without many doubts

**1968**  

1. Best  
2. Charlton  
3. Džajić  

Deserved win, but I think Eusebio could have definitely been in the top three after scoring 50 goals in 35 matches and reaching the CL semifinals, even if Portugal failed to qualify for the Euros which at the time had only 4 teams

**1969**  

1. Gianni Rivera  
2. Gigi Riva  
3. Muller

**1970**  

1. Muller 
2. Bobby Moore  
3. Gigi Riva  

**1971**  

1. Cruyff  
2. Mazzola  
3. Best  

**1972**  

1. Beckenbauer  
2. Muller  
3. Netzer  

Also thanks to their victory of the Euros the top 3 was all German and very close for number of points, with Cruyff being close as well in fourth position after Ajax won the treble. This was also the year where Muller scored an incredible 85 goals which was the new record and lasted till 2012, despite this there was no particular controversy since Beckenbauer was simply considered the best player of the team

**1973**  

1. Cruyff  
2. Zoff  
3. Muller 

Special mention for the third place Gerd Muller, who finished what he started in the previous year by ending the season with an incredible total of 66 goals

**1974**  

1. Cruyff  
2. Beckenbauer  
3. Kazimierz Deyna  

**1975**  

1. Blochin  
2. Beckenbauer  
3. Cruyff  

Despite being a name mostly forgotten and the incredible competition (even if not in their best year), Blochin's award was deserved and also won by a large margin

**1976**  

1. Beckenbauer  
2. Rensenbrink  
3. Ivo Viktor  

**1977**  

1. Simonsen  
2. Keegan  
3. Platini 

In general it was a quite weak edition, while for the winner it could have gone either way between Simonsen and Keegan

**1978**  

1. Keegan  
2. Krankl  
3. Rensenbrink  

Definitely the weirdest case so far, Keegan wasn't remotely as good as in the previous season or also as the following one but in the end still got the award. We can't even say he had no competition considering Krankl was very close for number of points after scoring over 40 goals during the year between Rapid Vienna and Barcelona, plus 4 with Austria at the World Cup for which England didn't even qualify. In any case it was another good candidate for the weakest edition ever

**1979**  

1. Keegan  
2. Rummenigge  
3. Ruud Krol  

**1980**  

1. Rummenigge  
2. Bernd Schuster  
3. Platini  

**1981**  

1. Rummenigge  
2. Breitner  
3. Bernd Schuster  

**1982**  

1. Rossi  
2. Giresse  
3. Boniek  

Paolo Rossi was disqualified for all the first part of the year but was also the best player of the World Cup won by Italy, in a year with a bit less competition for the award

**1983**  

1. Platini  
2. Dalglish  
3. Simonsen  

**1984**  

1. Platini  
2. Tigana  
3. Elkjaer  

**1985**  

1. Platini  
2. Elkjær  
3. Bernd Schuster  

**1986**  

1. Belanov  
2. Lineker  
3. Butragueño

It should be noted this was the year where Maradona would have easily won if eligible thanks to his season with Napoli and his legendary World Cup, in any case it was very controversial as the other two options would have both been better than Belanov

**1987**  

1. Gullit  
2. Futre  
3. Butragueno  

**1988**  

1. Van Basten  
2. Gullit  
3. Rijkaard 

This season PSV won a treble but the top 3 was all Dutch players playing for Milan, after The Netherlands won the Euros with a very dominant performance

**1989**  

1. Van Basten  
2. Baresi  
3. Rijkaard  

Once again all Milan players in the top three, Baresi had one of the best seasons ever for a defender but Van Basten was still considered the best player of the team and won without problems

**1990**  

1. Matthaus  
2. Schillaci  
3. Brehme  

**1991**  

1. Papin  
2. Savićević/Matthaus/Pančev

Surprisingly there were three players with the same number of points in second position, but all quite far from Papin even if with some complaints

**1992**  

1. Van Basten  
2. Stoichkov  
3. Bergkamp  

**1993**  

1. Baggio  
2. Bergkamp  
3. Cantona  

**1994**  

1. Stoichkov  
2. Baggio  
3. Maldini  

Stoichkov probably deserved it even if Baggio was an equally good candidate for the best player of the year (apart from Romario, not eligible), but unfortunately missing a penalty and losing the World Cup final seriously damaged his chances and partly also his reputation

**1995**  

1. Weah  
2. Klinsmann  
3. Litmanen

First year where non-Europeans players were allowed and the winner was Weah who is from Liberia, despite some minor complaints I think the award was deserved 

**1996**  

1. Sammer  
2. Ronaldo  
3. Shearer  

A controversial edition, after a very strong start Ronaldo spent the second part of the season injured at Psv, but at the Olympics with Brazil and with Barcelona after the summer transfer he had an incredible second part of the year showing things never seen before. Sammer on the other hand had a great year with Borussia Dortmund and Germany, winning the Euros as one of the best players of the tournament and then also the Ballon D'or by just 1 point  

**1997**  

1. Ronaldo  
2. Mijatović  
3. Zidane  

Probably one of the easiest vote ever, more than anything else I'm surprised Ronaldo didn't achieve the record for the win with the highest margin

Summary of his season, at just 21 years old: he was dribbling, scoring and doing what he wanted against 90% of the teams he faced, ending up with 60 goals and assists with Barcelona plus almost 30 (!) with Brazil and being decisive for winning Copa del Rey, Spanish Supercup and the Uefa Cup with the first and Copa America plus Confederations Cup with the other

**1998**  

1. Zidane  
2. Suker  
3. Ronaldo  

**1999**  

1. Rivaldo  
2. Beckham  
3. Schevchenko  

Some people wanted Beckham to win after probably being the best player of Manchester United which won the treble, but between Barcelona and Brazil Rivaldo had an even better individual performance so I think it was deserved

**2000**  

1. Figo  
2. Zidane  
3. Schevchenko  

Figo had an amazing season, but at the same time many thought the winner could have been Zidane and there is a possibility the voters were influenced by his polemical behavior and the red cards got during the year which certainly didn't help his chances

**2001**  

1. Owen  
2. Raul  
3. Kahn  

A lot of controversies, Owen had a good season with both Liverpool and England but Raul a definitely better one, and in any case I think Figo could have been above both after being as good as in the previous year

**2002**  

1. Ronaldo  
2. Roberto Carlos  
3. Kahn  

Ronaldo spent the first half of the year playing sporadically after having returned from the injury that kept him sidelined for two years after breaking his knee twice, but then won the World Cup while being the top scorer and won the award. There were some complaints about winning it just for the tournament, but it's also true that in this year the other candidates weren't as strong and Roberto Carlos was the main competition, with Kahn and Zidane coming right after

**2003**  

1. Nedvěd  
2. Henry  
3. Maldini  

This case is controversial but mostly in retrospect, at the time there weren't many complaints (Nedved was nominated the best player of Serie A and the best midfielder of the Champions League, reaching the final with Juventus), but considering how the rest of their careers went and that the other two never managed to win the Ballon D'or many think that either Henry or Maldini should have won it that year as some sort of compensation

**2004**  

1. Schevchenko  
2. Deco  
3. Ronaldinho  

Shevchenko had another fantastic season with Milan, but he wasn't clearly ahead of the competition and Deco, Henry and Ronaldinho could have all been other good candidates depending on personal preferences

**2005**  

1. Ronaldinho  
2. Lampard  
3. Gerrard  

**2006**  

1. Cannavaro  
2. Buffon  
3. Henry  

Few controversies at the time, but it was a really tough year and I'm not totally convinced of the podium which I think was also influenced by the headbutt in the final and Juventus getting relegated for Calciopoli. Otherwise I would have expected Buffon, Cannavaro and maybe Zidane as the top three, followed by Henry (who unfortunately lost both the CL and WC finals) and then Ronaldinho who was probably the favourite before the World Cup

**2007**  

1. Kakà  
2. C. Ronaldo  
3. Messi  

**2008**  

1. C. Ronaldo  
2. Messi  
3. Torres  

**2009**  

1. Messi  
2. C. Ronaldo  
3. Xavi  

**2010**  

1. Messi  
2. Iniesta  
3. Xavi  

All Barcelona podium and a lot of controversies even if especially in retrospect, I think a better podium would have been Messi, Xavi and Sneijder (Iniesta missed about a dozen matches due to injuries including some important ones), but it's difficult to think than one of them could have been above Messi who had the most impressive individual season since Ronaldo in 1997. At the time most of the opposed people were Inter fans but not everybody agreed, given that many instead preferred Milito's season (incredibly not even in the shortlist) 

**2011**  

1. Messi  
2. C. Ronaldo  
3. Xavi  

**2012**  

1. Messi  
2. C. Ronaldo  
3. Iniesta  

**2013**  

1. C. Ronaldo   
2. Messi  
3. Ribery  

Ribery was probably the best player of the treble-winning Bayern, but Ronaldo's individual season was still clearly superior. If anything the real controversy is that for the first time the voting period was extended by two weeks with late notice, in which Ronaldo gave his best performance of the year against Sweden  

**2014**  

1. C. Ronaldo
2. Messi  
3. Neuer  

Neuer played an excellent season and as a goalkeeper he couldn't have done much more, but so did Ronaldo who was as good as in the previous year and also won the Champions League with Real Madrid

**2015**  

1. Messi  
2. C. Ronaldo  
3. Neymar  

**2016**  

1. C. Ronaldo  
2. Messi  
3. Griezmann   

No controversy, but it would have been interesting to see Suarez's position if only he had a better reputation after all the bitings and constant diving. But in general it wasn't a great edition for strikers since Ibrahimovic arrived only 13th after the arguably best season of his career, while Higuain received 0 votes after beating the 70-years-old scoring record of Serie A with 36 goals

**2017**  

1. C. Ronaldo  
2. Messi  
3. Neymar  

I remember not being totally convinced about Neymar arriving third after a less impressive season than the previous ones, and I would have preferred to have Buffon on the podium (11 years since the last time) who instead finished fourth

**2018**  

1. Modric  
2. C. Ronaldo  
3. Griezmann  

Some controversies, mostly due to several great performances both in Champions League and at the World Cup. Messi should have probably been in the top three, but at the same time having out of the podium Salah or Griezmann after their respective best seasons would have been a real pity. As for the winner instead, Ronaldo's transfer to Juve definitely didn't help him but it should be reminded that Modric was named the best midfielder of the Champions League and the best player of the World Cup, later winning not only the Ballon D'or but also the Best Fifa Award and the UEFA Player of the Year all with big margin, so it was a true plebiscite

**2019**  

1. Messi  
2. Van Dijk  
3. C. Ronaldo  

Messi had one of the best seasons of his career and rightfully won the award, but Van Dijk had an excellent season too and won the Champions League with Liverpool surprisingly managing to finish quite close for number of points

**2020**  

The Ballon D'or was canceled in March after Covid caused some leagues to end early and postponed the Euros and Copa America. However after a while things resumed even if with some differences (no fans in the stadiums, only one leg in Champions League etc) and Bayern won an incredible sextuple with Lewandowski being clearly the best player of the team

They still decided to not award it due to the difficulties of organizing the vote and the award ceremony, but given such a clear winner they could have certainly made an exception and to this day it remains a very confusing decision

**2021**  

1. Messi
2. Lewandowski
3. Jorginho

A lot of controversies, starting from Jorginho who definitely shouldn't have been third over Benzema, Mbappe or also Kanté. As for the the winner, Messi was great with Barcellona and after winning the Copa America while being the best player he became the clear favourite well ahead of Lewandowski, but some of the public opinion shifted after his disappointing debut with Psg while at the same time Lewandowski had an excellent start of the season with an average of over a goal per match. Most of this however happened in a period that doesn't count since the voting phase ends in October, and in fact those months at the start of a new season should only influence the following award

**2022**  

1. Benzema
2. Mané
3. De Bruyne

A clear winner with no doubts, but while I think De Bruyne third is fine even if it wasn't his best individual season several players could have been in the podium instead of Mané like Lewandowski, Salah or Mbappe (who had almost 80 goals and assists between Psg and France, his personal record...)

**2023**  

1. Messi
2. Haaland
3. Mbappe

Messi played well with PSG and then won the World Cup with one of the best performances ever in the competition, but the award still wasn't assured since Manchester City managed to achieve a treble. The main candidate was Haaland, the top scorer of the team with 50 goals, but it costed him a lot not being clearly considered the best player of his team over De Bruyne or Rodri, especially in the most important matches of the season

**2024**  

1. Rodri
2. Vinicius Junior
3. Bellingham

Very surprised by the result which in fact caused a lot of controversies, Real Madrid won the Champions League and Vinicius was the best player of the competition which together with a quite weak competition made his victory seem almost guaranteed. Rodri on the other hand had a very good season with City but became a serious candidate only after winning the Euros with Spain and being nominated best player of the competition, which however I don't think he was especially over some of his teammates",18,7,2025-09-19T12:22:35,https://reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1nl22x7/oc_personal_analysis_of_all_the_controversial/,2025-09-20T11:47:43.637345

1nk7c49,post,champions league,soccer,Loose-Examination-39,Sir Bobby Robson. the bond between Barça and Newcastle,"
> FC Barcelona will kick off their Champions League campaign with a trip to Newcastle United – a meeting between two clubs with little shared history, but one deeply significant link: Sir Bobby Robson. The Englishman left his mark on both institutions, albeit in very different ways – just one season at Barça, five years at St James’ Park – and yet his legacy remains undimmed. His arrival in Catalonia back in 1996 was no easy task either, stepping into the shoes of Johan Cruyff, a figure of almost mythical status at Camp Nou.

> Robson and Ronaldo:

> Robson’s credentials were impeccable. He had taken England to a World Cup semi-final, won two Dutch titles with PSV, and added two Portuguese championships, two Super Cups and a domestic cup with Porto. So when Barça turned to him in the summer of 1996, he was tasked with managing a dressing room featuring Stoichkov, Guardiola, Figo, Luis Enrique… and a new Brazilian arrival by the name of Ronaldo.

> That 1996/97 season would forever be remembered as Robson’s year – but above all, Ronaldo’s. Signed from PSV, the striker scored 47 goals in 51 games before moving on to Inter, his exploits seared into the collective memory of Culers.

> Three trophies and a historic night:

> None of it, though, could be separated from Robson. Gentle, kind, and a master of man-management, he held together a dressing room with players from ten different nationalities and led them to a treble of trophies – the Cup Winners’ Cup, Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup.

> And then there was that night at Camp Nou. Having drawn 2-2 away to Atlético Madrid in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals, Barça found themselves 3-0 down at home at half-time, all three goals scored by Milinko Pantic. Robson reshaped his side, stirred their hearts, and inspired a comeback that has gone down in folklore.

> Ronaldo struck twice in quick succession, only for Pantic to make it 4-2. But then came the avalanche: Figo for 4-3, Ronaldo again for 4-4, and Pizzi with the winner, the stadium in raptures. The players delivered the miracle, but much of the credit belonged to Robson.

> Pep Guardiola summed it up years later: “I learned then that you only notice a coach in the bad moments. And he was always smiling. I could never have reacted the way he did. That was the moment I started thinking I wanted to be a coach, because of how he managed that situation.”

> Final years at home:

> After leaving Barça, Robson returned briefly to PSV before, in 1999, destiny handed him the job he had always dreamed of – manager of his boyhood club, Newcastle United. They were his final five years in the dugout, and he gave the Toon two seasons of Champions League football, including a meeting with Barça in 2003, when the visitors ran out 2-0 winners at St James’ Park thanks to goals from Patrick Kluivert and Thiago Motta.

> That was the last encounter between the two clubs. Over two decades on, they meet again. Sir Bobby passed away in 2009 after his battle with cancer, but his memory endures – and as Barça prepare to face Newcastle once more, there can be no better time to remember a true English gentleman of the game.

* 3 - Platini
* 3 - Van Basten
* 2 - Di Stefano
* 2 - Beckenbauer
* 2 - Keegan
* 2 - Rummenigge

Ranking if the controversial ones went differently:

* 8 - Messi (or 7 at worst even if I don't agree)
* 5 - C. Ronaldo
* 3/4 - Di Stefano
* 3 - Cruyff

Another thing to note is that if the award had started about ten years earlier, immediately after WWII, Puskas would have probably won at least 3 times

While if the South American players had been eligible since the start, obviusly also adding some journalists from the continent to the jury, we would have probably had several different results like:

* Garrincha winning in 1962
* Pelè would have probably been in the top three about 10 times and won at least 5 awards (1961, 1963, 1964, 1969 and 1970 the most likely, for 1958, 1959 and 1960 it would have been more difficult considering he was younger and against another legend like Di Stefano, then in 1962 he had a much better club season than Garrincha but at the same time was injured for most of the World Cup which would have had a lot of weight, while in 1965 he wasn't clearly better than Eusebio so I think it would have been a 50/50)
* Kempes winning in 1978
* Zico winning at least one between 1977 and 1982
* Maradona winning in 1986 and probably 1987, with good chances of being in the top 3 also in 1989 and 1990 as well as already in 1979 and 1980 with Argentinos Juniors

1nklwg6,post,champions league,ChampionsLeague,iamhadi12,"New Champions League format, or is it really?","Alright so, here's my 2 cents, and i use that term loosely, it's more like 2 million dollars because ima write a lot, but anywhoooo

First things first I absolutely think this new format is in every way, shape or form better than the old one, I mean if we are comparing them, but it's not exactly in the best form it can be in, here's why;

So when they first explained the new format the first thing I wondered if they would do, is make seeding/positions actually matter...

What I mean is, they said that now every game is important, the league phase is an improvement (which it is), and your position in this league is going to matter, it's not just about qualification..

Cool, but not true

Let's start with last year, at first, what they didn't really explain much, was how seeding was going to matter, they said there would be a draw and I wondered, what's the point of a draw? How would the team that finished 1st benefit more than a team that finished 8? How would the team that finished 9th benefit more than a team that finished 16th? then I found out they were going to do it 9th vs 23rd or 24th, and i figured, it's still stupid, but better than nothing (stupid as in, just do highest vs lowest seed, 9th vs 24th directly, and so on)

But the even dumber idea was, that there was an 'open draw' for who would play the second leg at home in the quarterfinals and semifinals, so teams like Barcelona and Arsenal did not benefit at all from their league position..

Now we come to this season..

I heard that UEFA has changed this, with the venue of the second leg now based upon merit from the League Phase..

BUT, again, their definition of merit and benefiting from the league phase is still very flawed and what bothers me is how they can mess up something that could be so so simple and they should figure it out themselves because THEY LITERALLY SET THE BLUEPRINT FOR IT.

So, apparently... lower ranked teams could 'win' priority off higher ranked teams they beat, for example if it happens that a team ranked 15th, like PSG last season, beat a team ranked 1st, like Liverpool last season, they would get home advantage from them.. like PSG would become '1st seed' technically, gaining advantage over literally every other team that finished above them..

So it's not that they're re-ranking each tie based only upon League Phase placings, which should clearly be the case, no they're instead giving priority to teams who knocked out ranks 1-4, so in other words, it puts the teams who finish third or fourth at a disadvantage, because it is now impossible for either be at home in the second leg of a semifinal..

Only the teams who finish in the following positions can get a home second leg in the semifinal: first, second, seventh, eighth, ninth, 10th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 23rd, 24th.. Just reading this feels so stupid..

Like the simplest thing they could do is give home advantage to the higher seed in any tie, that's literally the simplest thing they could do..

And I'm saying it's the simplest thing they could do because, if I'm going further with this, to give this new format an actual purpose, I'd eliminate draws altogether, which actually should have been the case...

Highest seed plays lowest seed in every round, that's it, that's as simple as it should be.

Football fans tend to make fun of the NFL all the time (and I'm guilty of even calling it 'handegg' long ago before actually giving it the benefit of doubt, watching it, and enjoying it)

But at least in this sense they got it right. their 'league phase' actually matters, every single game is important..

Let's take last year's quarter finals for example, these are the teams that reached it:

Arsenal (3), Real Madrid (11), PSG (15), Aston Villa (8), Barcelona (2), Dortmund (10), Bayern (12), and Inter (4)

The matchups would be:

Barcelona (2) vs PSG (15)

Arsenal (3) vs Bayern (12)

Inter (4) vs Real Madrid (11)

Aston Villa (8) vs Dortmund (10)

with the team written first having home advantage in the 2nd leg, as they are the higher seed

note that I took the quarter finals only as an example, if this was applied from the first knockout round, the matchups at this point (quarter finals) would look different, as the seeding was flawed from the beginning.. PSG wouldn't have faced Liverpool in the RO16, Liverpool (1) would have faced Club Brugge (24)

That's it, that's how simple it should be, and that's how you make the league phase matter, and actually make the change to this new format mean something..",3,19,2025-09-18T22:06:31,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nklwg6/new_champions_league_format_or_is_it_really/,2025-09-20T11:48:25.722390

1nkbdoq,post,champions league,ChampionsLeague,aboss101,Mahrez clear of Salah overall,"Mahrez is levels above Salah overall. Salah didn’t even win the Champions League in 2018, and when it comes to finals he goes missing every time. He’s never shown up on the international stage either, unlike Mahrez who delivered for Algeria when it mattered most.

Salah usually ghosts at the end of the season, plays rubbish for most of the game, then nicks a “scam goal” so people think he’s world class. Meanwhile, Mahrez has real technical ability, steps up in big moments, and has proven himself time and time again for club and country.

Rival fans and especially Liverpool fans need to stop overrating him and calling him the “best ever” in the Premier League — he’s not even close. If you’ve got eyes, you know Mahrez is the more complete footballer.",0,32,2025-09-18T15:27:59,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nkbdoq/mahrez_clear_of_salah_overall/,2025-09-20T11:48:34.929743

If there is a mistake somewhere, let me know. Slavia Praha took the crown by beating Lille in Qualifying in one leg, (they lost the other leg by a lot) and now they aim to defend their title.

1nk5x3w,post,champions league,ChampionsLeague,planmoretrips,Juventus Vs Borussia Dortmund [4-4] – Post Match Tactical Analysis,"Juventus played their first UEFA Champions League match of the 2025/2026 season against Borussia Dortmund, and the game ended with a very dramatic late draw after the Bianconeri scored their fourth goal to equalise. 

The result cannot be considered positive for Juventus, as they were playing at home and were hoping to kick off this initial phase with a win despite facing a tough opponent in BVB. 

But, given the chronology of events and the teams positive attitude and reaction to the game, Juventus can be happy about the second half and their ability to get back in the game after they were two goals behind. 

That’s why it will be crucial to build on this comeback and the way Juventus dealt with the second half, especially from an attacking and playmaking perspective. 

At the same time, it will be even more urgent to focus extensively on the team’s defensive performance and try fixing what went wrong in this game, in order to avoid conceding many goals per match in the future. 

The fact that Juventus conceded three goals in the previous game against Inter Milan and four goals against Borussia Dortmund is alarming. 

Head coach Igor Tudor must seriously consider this to guarantee more balance in the team’s performances, whether in Serie A or UEFA Champions League games. 

Therefore, this tactical analysis of the match between Juventus and Borussia Dortmund will explore Juventus’ defensive issues and analyse why they conceded four goals in a single match. 

The analysis will also reserve a section to explore the impact of Kenan Yıldız and Dušan Vlahović on the game, as well as the positives and negatives of the Bianconeri’s attacking performance in this opening UEFA Champions League game.

1njc77g,post,champions league,ChampionsLeague,vulcan2jz,"Juve Vs BVB, a true spectacle","Yesterday I had the opportunity to watch Borussia Dortmund and Juventus go head-to-head in the league phase of the Champions League. An absolute treat for the neutrals, for Juventus fans another heart-in-mouth match, for Dortmund a missed opportunity. I wanted to share my thoughts and observations I penned during the match. The game was the story of star quality and the benefits of having a star-studded bench, as on paper, both used the same formations, a 3-4-2-1, where only Juve made several changes to their starting lineups with the inclusion of Jonathan David, Luis Openda and Koopmeiners. The tactical plan of Nico Kovac surprised me as 2 of their 3 centre-backs were actually a CM and an RB, respectively. Whether or not they would be uncomfortable playing said roles piqued my curiosity; to my astonishment, BVB looked the more composed during the first half, but there was this hesitation that was displayed by both teams. Juve had so many positional rotations amongst their front three with Thuram supporting them by filling the gaps, yet BVB remained stubborn, and the scores were 0-0 by halftime. The second half was much different; both Openda and  David had real close chances, but it was the star players of both teams that started the rollercoaster that the fans were about to witness. Firstly, Adeyemi with a brilliant hit, followed by Yildiz with a curler. Followed up by Nmecha, who played brilliantly upto his substitution, being the provider and scorer for the first two goals BVB had scored. So calm and composed in that two-man midfield alongside Sabitzer, being a fulcrum of that BVB team. But then Juve Struck back through Vlahovic within four minutes after BVB scored their second, and then the game turned into a boxing match where blows were coming left and right. Yan Cuoto followed up on the action with the third goal, and the game somewhat cooled down, which was then exacerbated by BVB conceding a penalty, converted brilliantly by Bensebaini. The game looked all set for BVB to get all three points, but the substitute Vlahovic stepped up with a goal and an assist in the final 10 minutes of the match. This match highlighted the importance of balance between attack and defence, risk-taking, controlling nerves, also known as composure, and the benefits of having quality substitutes who are eager to make an impact whenever called upon. Just a beautiful display of grit, determination, and tactical battles, and a joy to have been able to watch this match.",28,21,2025-09-17T12:47:37,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1njc77g/juve_vs_bvb_a_true_spectacle/,2025-09-20T11:48:44.950804

I though about how the NFL does it better, I think the NBA has a similar structure. If you're going to have a playoff then the position in that play off should matter A LOT. If you finished first you should play the team that finishes dead last, then 2nd plays second to last and so on and so forth. There are some leagues that also do bye weeks, where the team that finished 1st and 2nd automatically qualify to the following round (essentially skipping a round) but that would be pushing it here.",1,0,2025-09-18T22:35:17,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nklwg6/new_champions_league_format_or_is_it_really/neyywj1/,2025-09-20T11:48:26.132242

When it comes to 2B spent, its not the same situation as 20 years ago. So many teams are competitive in the market, and spending 2B compared to spending 1B doesnt bring you much of an advantage as spending 200m compared to 100m did 20 years ago. There is a cap on how much you can improve your team with just money today and a lot of teams hit that cap today. Much more important is having a clear plan, scouting, getting a right profile of players and having a good coach. Chelsea had none of it (except for decent coaches).",7,0,2025-09-18T19:43:49,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nkdilz/carragher_rips_into_chelsea_on_cbs_mourinhos_old/ney0mw5/,2025-09-20T11:48:32.803174

But, would be more logical if you took the home- and away- games in account. ManU in 69 for instance. Got knocked out against Milan, but keeps the title? And keeps that title for 35 years because it doesnt participate? Doesn’t sounds fair to me.

In boxing, when the boxer gets injured and cannot defend his title, he forfeits. That would also be more logical in this scenario, imho.",3,0,2025-09-18T12:40:53,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nk66zp/according_to_boxing_rules_slavia_praha_are/nevlybt/,2025-09-20T11:48:36.270319

This idea came to me when we won the treble champions league trophy, 

Been supporting this club from a very very early age. 

The second tattoo I did, to finalise the it, however, there is one more part missing, which will be added in time. 🕰️

The club is my blood and in my heart! 

The greatest club in the history of football, Real Madrid.

1ng4bk2,post,champions league,realmadrid,vindex_,Real Madrid will file a complaint to FIFA over refereeing,"Source: Marca
Translation: Google

Real Madrid Television announced it at 6:50 p.m. News. Real Madrid is preparing a dossier on what happened from the refereeing perspective in these first four matchdays of La Liga and last season to send to FIFA so they can take note of what's happening in Spain. The Whites were outraged by the refereeing incident at Anoeta and decided to make public a measure they have been working on for some time. ""It's a shame we have to talk about this scandal and not about Mbappé's great game or Tchouaméni's 150 matches,"" they stated on RMTV, where they insisted. ""Real Madrid will present this report so that FIFA can take note.""

The Real Madrid club ended the match against Real Sociedad outraged by Huijsen's red card, which wasn't reviewed by VAR despite Oyarzabal being on the touchline, 50 meters from goal, and Militao being level with the Malaga native. ""The fact that the referee wasn't given the chance to review it..."" the players lamented. Even Xabi Alonso, usually calm with the referees, couldn't believe it, received a yellow card for protesting, and ended up demanding an explanation from the referee. 

On Real Madrid television, they're reporting on a red card report dating back to the Negreira era , stating that Barça's record against the Reds is +65 , while Real Madrid is at -2 . In the Champions League, the club claims, the record is +12 for Barça and +13 for Real Madrid. They don't understand why, in the 21st century, Barça has a winning record in 65 games playing with a man advantage, while Real Madrid has a winning record in two games playing with one less man.  

Mbappé's disallowed goal against Güler for offside didn't raise as many eyebrows, although Real Madrid believes the VAR frame rate is detrimental to them in 90% of cases. Once again, the Frenchman's offside position was pinpoint accurate. 

Madrid does not change its policy
The Whites made it clear before the season began that they weren't happy with the changes to the CTA and that they wouldn't stop until all the referees or directors who had had contact with Negreira were removed. The war continues, and the start of the season isn't helping.

Because Madrid is no longer just denouncing the refereeing decisions it suffered, but that report will also reveal facts such as the fact that the Rayo-Barça match was played without VAR during certain phases of the match, coinciding, for example, with a non-existent penalty on Lamine Yamal. 

Madrid will take all of this to FIFA, a complaint that serves as a measure of pressure in response to what it considers ""a constant abuse"" that began with Negreira.

1nfyqcv,post,champions league,realmadrid,Mafia-_-Panda,What kit screams Modric?,"When you think about the elegance and brilliance of Luka Modrić—the way he glides across the pitch, dictating play with vision, precision, and composure—there are countless iconic moments tied to his career. From his unforgettable performances at Real Madrid, where he has lifted Champions League trophies, to leading Croatia’s golden generation to a World Cup final, Modrić has worn some legendary kits. But here’s the real question: out of all the jerseys he’s graced throughout his career—whether it’s the famous white of Madrid, the checkered red-and-white of Croatia, or even his earlier days at Tottenham—what kit truly screams Modrić?

1nl6399,post,champions league,Barca,statsgenius,Rashford just casually became the first Englishman to score for Barca in UCL since Lineker 36 years ago ! And did it with 2 bangers from 0.37 xG,"Just saw the numbers from Rashford's Champions League debut and honestly didn't expect them to be this good. 6 shots, 10 touches in the box, 5 completed dribbles, and somehow managed 2 goals from just 0.37 xG - that's either incredible finishing or we got lucky lol. 



That 25-yard screamer in the 67th minute was pretty sweet though, and apparently he's the first English player to score for us in UCL since Lineker in '89 which is kind of a cool stat. Now sitting at 2 goals and 1 assist in 5 appearances total this season. 



Still early days obviously and one good game doesn't make a signing, but the performance against Newcastle was definitely encouraging.

1nk6wn9,post,champions league,Barca,Loose-Examination-39,Sir Bobby Robson. the bond between Barça and Newcastle,"> FC Barcelona will kick off their Champions League campaign with a trip to Newcastle United – a meeting between two clubs with little shared history, but one deeply significant link: Sir Bobby Robson. The Englishman left his mark on both institutions, albeit in very different ways – just one season at Barça, five years at St James’ Park – and yet his legacy remains undimmed. His arrival in Catalonia back in 1996 was no easy task either, stepping into the shoes of Johan Cruyff, a figure of almost mythical status at Camp Nou.

> Robson and Ronaldo:

> Robson’s credentials were impeccable. He had taken England to a World Cup semi-final, won two Dutch titles with PSV, and added two Portuguese championships, two Super Cups and a domestic cup with Porto. So when Barça turned to him in the summer of 1996, he was tasked with managing a dressing room featuring Stoichkov, Guardiola, Figo, Luis Enrique… and a new Brazilian arrival by the name of Ronaldo.

> That 1996/97 season would forever be remembered as Robson’s year – but above all, Ronaldo’s. Signed from PSV, the striker scored 47 goals in 51 games before moving on to Inter, his exploits seared into the collective memory of Culers.

> Three trophies and a historic night:

> None of it, though, could be separated from Robson. Gentle, kind, and a master of man-management, he held together a dressing room with players from ten different nationalities and led them to a treble of trophies – the Cup Winners’ Cup, Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup.

> And then there was that night at Camp Nou. Having drawn 2-2 away to Atlético Madrid in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals, Barça found themselves 3-0 down at home at half-time, all three goals scored by Milinko Pantic. Robson reshaped his side, stirred their hearts, and inspired a comeback that has gone down in folklore.

> Ronaldo struck twice in quick succession, only for Pantic to make it 4-2. But then came the avalanche: Figo for 4-3, Ronaldo again for 4-4, and Pizzi with the winner, the stadium in raptures. The players delivered the miracle, but much of the credit belonged to Robson.

> Pep Guardiola summed it up years later: “I learned then that you only notice a coach in the bad moments. And he was always smiling. I could never have reacted the way he did. That was the moment I started thinking I wanted to be a coach, because of how he managed that situation.”

> Final years at home:

> After leaving Barça, Robson returned briefly to PSV before, in 1999, destiny handed him the job he had always dreamed of – manager of his boyhood club, Newcastle United. They were his final five years in the dugout, and he gave the Toon two seasons of Champions League football, including a meeting with Barça in 2003, when the visitors ran out 2-0 winners at St James’ Park thanks to goals from Patrick Kluivert and Thiago Motta.

> That was the last encounter between the two clubs. Over two decades on, they meet again. Sir Bobby passed away in 2009 after his battle with cancer, but his memory endures – and as Barça prepare to face Newcastle once more, there can be no better time to remember a true English gentleman of the game.

Could anyone please guide me on how to purchase tickets for Barça’s upcoming Champions League away matches? I’m based in London and very keen to attend the game against Chelsea on 25th November 2025 with my kids.

* Arne Slot's Liverpool have now won their four Premier League games with late goals

\----

**Liverpool's flawless start to the defence of their Premier League crown is now being aided by an aura from another age.**

What was once ""Fergie Time"" is now ""Arne Time"".

It was a phrase used to describe the uncanny habit Sir Alex Ferguson's all-conquering Manchester United side had of breaking opponents' hearts with late, late shows.

The sight of teams slumped on the turf and opposing managers stunned while Ferguson and his players cavorted on the sidelines became a constant narrative as a great team achieved great successes.

They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery – and now we have Arne Slot's Liverpool repeating the old Ferguson punishment as they relentlessly pursue victories and trophies.

Liverpool's latest journey into ""Arne Time"" came at Turf Moor on Sunday after Scott Parker's Burnley resisted magnificently to move within seconds of becoming the first team to take points from the champions this season.

And then, with tired legs and tired minds taking over and Burnley down to 10 men after Lesley Ugochukwu was sent off after 84 minutes, Liverpool did it again.

In the dying seconds of five minutes of added time, Burnley substitute Hannibal recklessly handled Jeremie Frimpong's cross, leaving Mohamed Salah to complete the formalities from the penalty spot.

Liverpool had done it again. And done it in ""Arne Time"".

=====

* [](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cy5036q7qxvt)



The Reds have four Premier League wins out of four, all secured by late – some very, very late – goals.

Liverpool scored in the 88th minute, then in the fourth minute of stoppage time, to beat Bournemouth 4-2 in their opening game at Anfield, after they had conceded a 2-0 lead. Teenager Rio Ngumoha bagged a 100th-minute winner at Newcastle United, again after Liverpool had been two up.

Dominik Szoboszlai's decisive free-kick against Arsenal came seven minutes from time – and Salah followed suit with only seconds left at Burnley.

=====

As far as Slot's Liverpool is concerned, this is a new phenomenon.

Liverpool have already scored more 90th+ minute goals this season (3) than last term, with both in 2024-25 coming in the same game against Brentford in January, when Darwin Nunez struck twice.

In this recent run, Liverpool have become the first side in Premier League history to win four consecutive games with winning goals scored in the final 10 minutes or later.

The goal also extended Liverpool's club record run to 38 top-flight games in which they have scored - the last time they failed to find the net was a year ago on Sunday.

They will aim to equal Tottenham's run of 39 matches next weekend when they face Everton at Anfield, with Arsenal holding the record on 55 games.

=====

Burnley manager Scott Parker was devastated after Liverpool's stoppage-time penalty condemns his side to defeat

With this comes a psychological impact that adds to Liverpool's wide range of weapons.

As in the prime ""Fergie Time"" days, there is now an audible groan from opposing fans when the board goes up for added time when Liverpool are seeking a winner.

It happened when ""11"" went up with the score 2-2 at St James' Park. It was the same at Burnley when ""5"" flashed up beneath The Bob Lord Stand.

It all adds to the opposition's anxiety and Liverpool's power.

As the game ticks towards its conclusion, Liverpool are now inside opponents' heads, striking fear that a late goal is coming. This result was so cruel on Burnley, but no-one is safe, no points are taken against Liverpool, until the final whistle has sounded.



=====

In their own dramatic way, Liverpool are actually carrying out Slot's instructions from last season.

He said in January: ""One of the things I would like us to do better in the second half of the season than the first half, although it wasn't necessary that many times, is to make a late goal winner.

""Hopefully we don't come to these situations a lot but we definitely, if we are coming in those situations, have one, two or three times a moment where we do score in the last minute of the game when we deserve it.""

Slot said after those demands had been satisfied once more at Turf Moor: ""Compliments to Burnley for the way they defended. It was difficult for us to find an opening and a few times we were close.

""If we had scored, the game may have been open, but because we didn't they did the same thing. We had to wait until the end phase of the second half and in the final stages we got what were hoping for.

""There is a chance it will fall in the way you want, but it was difficult because they had players behind the ball. We needed a moment of luck, or a moment of magic.

""We didn't have the magic but we had the luck. You are hoping and trying to make it more difficult, but they were strong.""

The fact Liverpool have needed late goals in their first four Premier League wins illustrates that they have not yet been near their best this season – a frightening prospect for those hoping to take their crown off them, and with £125m striker Alexander Isak waiting in the wings.

Slot kept Isak back at Burnley, believing he was better employed working on his match fitness ahead of Wednesday's Champions League opener against Atletico Madrid at Anfield.



=====

It also, more significantly, shows the steel that runs through this Liverpool side. Strength of character to accompany the skill. A winning mentality attuned to the old adage of another managerial great, Brian Clough's ""it only takes a second to score a goal"".

Liverpool have not quite been winning ugly, but it has not been pretty. Ominous signs for their challengers.

In the usual hostile Turf Moor atmosphere, Burnley mounted fierce resistance and were superbly organised to frustrate Liverpool.

The last time Scott Parker managed against Liverpool, it ended in a 9-0 thrashing for Bournemouth at Anfield in August 2022, a humiliation that resulted in his sacking days later.

Here, Parker was 30 seconds from redemption as he set Burnley up superbly, with Liverpool restricted by keeper Martin Dubraka's saves from Szoboszlai and Frimpong, while a free header was directed wide by Federico Chiesa when the defensive stranglehold was loosened for once.

It was all to no avail. ""Arne Time"" was still to come.

1nlhdhp,post,champions league,chelseafc,CdrShprd,Man United vs Chelsea EPL pre-match: Enzo Maresca (transcript),"**questions in bold**, *answers in italics*

\- breaks between journalists

# [Press Conference: Enzo Maresca](https://youtu.be/t9GJWzoGIN8?si=LMKVh01Kx3DRXUM8)

**Obviously came off a very high of this summer, and unbeaten in the Premier League. How much was maybe - Wednesday - just a little bit of a realization of the work that Chelsea have over the next few months as you approach this game tomorrow?**

*I think Wednesday game is a normal game in terms of - it's Champions League game, it's Bayern Munich away. And we knew that was tough game. We try our best. I think for part of the game, we were very good, and then for sure there are things that we can do better - but like always. We don't like \[to\] lose game, for sure. But my feeling at the end of the game was a good feeling in terms of - we are here, and we're gonna play our part in this competition.*

**We've heard this week from the PFA, been checking in on a couple of your players. You spoke last week about the fact that you hadn't even spoken to Raheem Sterling when he hadn't got his move on deadline day. How comfortable are you with the situation that those players find themselves in? It wasn't long ago you were a player. How might you feel in their situation?**

*I've been in Raheem's situation, and Axel's situation as a player. And for sure, I know that is not the best feeling for a player, because if you are a player, that means you want to train and play game. But then for different reason, the situation is the situation that is in this moment, and I know that the club is giving them the opportunity to work in the right way, and this is the only thing I can say.*

**It feels like, from the outside, from what we've heard, training separately, eating separately. Not being a part. It seems quite extreme. Are you not worried about the long-term effect? I mean, what effect did that have on you** when **you were told to be by yourself and absolutely not be a part of what they \[inaudible\]?**

*I think - I know that something you probably you like and you want to talk about that. But it's not just Chelsea. It's any club in the world - I can promise you. Italy, Spain, England, France, USA, Brazil - any club in the world. When for any reason, the player and the club doesn't find any solution, you give the player all the tools to do training session and to do everything. But if you are not involved in the squad, you are not involved in the squad. Again, I know that it's something that you like to talk about, but it's not about Chelsea. It's about any club in the world.*

**I know, but it's about the human at the center of this, isn't it? It's like, their mental health. I-** 

*My father is 75 years old, and for 50 years, he has been fisherman - working for 2 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock in the morning. This is hard, in life. Not a player, the way they work.*

**A word on United, then. We've heard a lot from Amorim after what's been quite a difficult start to the season for him. He's speaking to his philosophies. As a modern manager, at a club where you don't always have total control over the players in and out, how much do you feel having that element of flexibility helps you to get to where you want to go?**

*The only thing I can say - that I really appreciate Ruben. I watch Ruben game since he was in Sporting. He's \[magnificent\] manager. Like all the manager, when you start a new project, sometime you can struggle a little bit more, a little bit less, but at the end you're gonna struggle. But I don't have any doubt that he's a fantastic manager.*

**-**

**Chelsea haven't won at Old Trafford in quite some time. I don't know if you know that but it's 2013, I think - 12 years since they won at Old Trafford. Is it fair to say this does look quite a good opportunity given the start that United have had?**

*I think it's always difficult to play United away in their stadium, Old Trafford. So I don't think that now is the right moment, or next year will be right moment or last year was the right moment. It's always* difficult*. It's a difficult team, it's a difficult stadium. I watch the games that they played this season - some of the* games *it's not a real result in terms of - even City game, until one-nil, two-nil, they were in the game. When the game was nil-nil, they had a few chances to score and to go ahead on the result, so - it will be a tough game, no doubt.*

**Player-wise how's Cole Palmer and are there any other injuries?**

*Cole is okay. We have a session now - we flew back yesterday. So we need to asses some of the players. We have some doubt. We didn't do any session since Wednesday game - and we see after.*

**It's gonna be like this, obviously, with Champions League, but does that give a team like Man United who had a \[inaudible\] you didn't get back til Thursday, you travel up to Manchester today.**

*Yeah, if you ask me, I prefer to play Champions League game - no doubt. But at the same time, the reality says that they had one entire week to prepare the game and we play a game two days ago, 24 hours ago, 48 hours ago. But again, I prefer to play Champion League games.*

**And given the win you had, obviously the draw at Brentford, the defeat in Munich, does it just put a little bit more pressure on this game at Old Trafford?**

*Absolutely not. Personally, I know I have pressure all the* game *that I want to try to win all the game. But it's not because we drew Brentford and we lost Bayern Munich away that this game I feel more pressure - I always have pressure because we want to win all the games. And again, I think Bayern Munich away, PSG away, and Barcelona away - probably they were* the *worst stadium to go and play the first game in Champion League. And we were there, we compete, face to face, and we see the next one.*

**-**

**Against Bayern Munich, of course outside of the really strong points there was some fatigue amongst some of the players that we could see, specifically mainly Joao Pedro, who had to lead the press a lot of the time and use his physicality. Of course you recalled Marc Guiu and he's very good at pressing, but how realistic is it in your plans to consistently use him in Delap's absence?**

*Marc is back. The reason why he's back is because the intention is to use him. But he needs to do things better. He needs to improve things. And for sure, we're gonna use him.* 

**When Palmer and Estevao play together, you have a right wing that likes 10 zones. You have a 10 that likes drifting into the right half-space. Who do you prefer to play wider in general? And just on the back of Estevao, how much do you think he can develop and be great in that 10 role?**

*Estevao can be great in all the attacking positions, because his talent is very good - he's top player. But at the same time he's 17, 18 years old, so - he's 18 years old - he needs time, a little bit. But I think both, they can play wide. Both, they can play as a 10. And I feel very lucky to have both of them with us.*

**Last season I remember we spoke ahead of a Newcastle game and they were in a difficult period - that this is the hardest time to play a team like that. As mentioned, Manchester United are an up-and-down sort of situation right now. What do you think are their main threats that could be used against you this weekend?**

*They have, first of all, the desire to win this game after - when you struggle, you are always with desire to - the next one is the one that we want to win. So the desire to win, again, against Chelsea, at home, in front of their fans. So there are all reason that they can be very important for them.* 

**-**

**Garnacho - how do you think he's started under you, and how do you think he's mentally prepared to go back to his old club? Do you tink he's ready to start in a game where we don't know what kind of atmosphere, what reception he might get?**

*In the last two games, he was inside very good - came in very good in the second half against Brentford and the other day against Bayern Munich. So we are happy in the way he's adapting our style, what we want from the winger. Now if he's ready to start tomorrow - yeah, I think he's ready to start.*

**And so - do you think he should get a good reception from the Man United fans given that he seemed to leave in a very unhappy way?**

*I don't know, Simon, to be honest. I don't know. It's a question for the fans, not for me.* 

**Can he handle it, though, if he does get a tough reception? Do you think he's got the - he's quite a young, young player.**

*Yeah, yeah. It's always difficult. The other day, against Bayern Munich - Cucurella, every time he touched the ball, the noise was not the best one, but you have to learn also to handle these kinds of things.*",40,1,2025-09-19T22:26:36,https://reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1nlhdhp/man_united_vs_chelsea_epl_prematch_enzo_maresca/,2025-09-20T11:50:09.161938

\- breaks between journalists

\[apologies for posting this later than I would have liked\]

# [Press Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qTpIOxZ178)

# Enzo Maresca

**In terms of the your actual squad, with the Champions League, you're relatively inexperienced with the Champions League. However, obviously with your European success last year and the Club World Cup as well, how do you marry up your expectations for this Champions League season?**

*First of all, we are very happy to be in this competition. One year ago we were playing Conference League playoff, so we are happy to be here. For sure, winning the Conference League and Club World Cup help in different aspect. And then in terms of experience, I think all of us, when we start something, we are lack of experience - we have to start, and we're going to start tomorrow.*

**-**

**Is there a belief from your side - the squad - that you can really challenge and go on and win this competition this season?**

*First of all, you know already, since last season that I always like to go game by game - you cannot think about the final or semi-final if you are not able to win games in the group stage, and it's the first thing. Tomorrow we have the first one against a fantastic team, that probably is one of the three, four favorite in this competition, but we're going to try to do our job in the best way.*

**What did winning the Conference League and the Club World Cup - have you noticed a difference in the squad since you came back from \[inaudible\]?**

*Absolutely, yes. Yeah, when you win game, for sure help to improve confidence, to improve different things, different aspect - knowing that every game is different, every competition is different. And as I said, Bayern this moment probably is one of the favorite one - but we are gonna try to do our best.*

***-***

**Obviously last season, in the Conference League, you were able to have almost two teams - a Premier League team and a Europe team. You won't be able to do that this time. So is it important you field your best possible 11 - and will Cole Palmer start?**

*We try every game - even against Brentford - we try with our best 11. Game by game you have to manage different problems. As I said in the last game, Cole was not fit 100% to play 90 minutes. Different players were out - Estevao for instance. And tomorrow we're going to try to put our best 11 for tomorrow game. Cole, three days ago, he didn't play from the start because he was not able to do that. We see tomorrow.*

**-**

**Without asking you to name your team tomorrow, does the formula, the formation, the system that you used in the final against PSG give you kind of template to use in these big games in the Champions League this season?**

*I said before, for me, every game is different. For that game* against *PSG, I think the first 11, the ones that they were inside second half, the plan - everything work well. But tomorrow is completely different game. So I don't see any comparation between the two teams.*

**-**

**Can I just ask you about how you feel about potentially going against Nicolas Jackson tomorrow night? He's obviously on loan to Bayern, but he's still sort of a Chelsea player. And what do you think of that rule that on-loan players in Europe can play against their parent clubs?**

*I said the other day - I'm grateful, thankful to Nico, because if we achieve what we achieved last year, it's because all the players - \[including\] Nicolas that was with us. I text him after he left the club, telling him thanks for last season, wish him all the best. And Nico is a good guy, with us was good - was working well. And then in terms of rule - for me it's normal. I'm from Italy. I played many years in Spain, and this rule - when you are loan, you can play, so it's okay.*

**Did Nico text you back?**

*Yes. Yeah, yeah.*

***-***

**Another question regarding Nico Jackson. You said you are thankful. Could you explain why you didn't count on him for this new season and, yeah, why you decided to let him join Bayern?**

*Because we bought two striker, Liam Delap and Joao Pedro. And I think with two striker it's a good number - it's enough. And this is the reason why.*

**-**

**You used Filip Jorgensen in Europe last season. Are you gonna tell us which goalie you're going to go with in the Champions League this season and explain the reason why?**

*Tomorrow Robbie will start. But for sure, with the amount of games that we have, Filip is going to play games in the Premier League, in the Champions League, in the FA Cup, in the Carabao. We have so many games that, for sure, Robert cannot play all of them.*

**-**

**You did a great job rotating your squad last season, but is it a bit different when you're rotating the squad now to the Champions League, because the level is so much higher? And is that a personal challenge for you this season, success or failure going to be dependent on how well you do that in all the competitions?**

*It helps a lot if you are able to rotate players. Especially - probably at the beginning of the season, okay, you can probably go with the same - and then it's a long season, many games. So I think you have to do that, because you have also save players, avoid injury. But it's something that is dictate game by game. It's not something that you can plan, because probably you plan something and then any problem or any injury - is not possible. So we're gonna try to rotate player, knowing that, as you said, the Champions League is a bit different from last season's competition.*

**-**

**Uli Hoeneß of Bayern Munich said Bayern Munich is the underdog in this season in the Champions League. Would you agree, or what is your opinion about Bayern Munich this year?**

*I think Bayern Munich is a team that already showed last year that they are very close and they can compete in this competition - try to win this competition. This is my personal view. I see them, together with three, four more clubs, like the favorite one for this competition - but it's my personal view.*

**-**

**Vincent Kompany earlier said that he has had a conversation with Nicolas about the way Chelsea played - obviously he knows the way you like to set things up and tactical style. Is there any concern that Nicolas can obviously give Bayern the low-down? And second, just to confirm your relationship with Jackson is good, because there's been some quotes out there today that perhaps it's not the best relationship.**

*Me with Nico?*

**Yeah.**

*(Laughs) Me personal, I - again, I didn't have any kind of problem with Nico and I don't have any problem with Nico. Again, he's a good guy, good professional, work well with us. And that's it. And then the other question - yeah, probably can be... small advantage because he can ask Nico the way we try to work, the way we try to prepare games - at the end, Nico was with us for one entire season, so he knows exactly the way we approach games. But at the end, we see.* 

# Reece James

**Loads of big days and nights in your career, but to be captaining Chelsea in the Champions League away at Bayern Munich - how big of a night is that for you?**

*No, it's a great night for me - it's something that I've dreamt of since a little boy, playing in this competition. And then to captain and walk out at such a historic stadium tomorrow, it's an amazing feeling.*

**-**

**I think Ben Chilwell who moved to Strasbourg - you're the last remaining player from the Champions League winning team. I think they're all gone now. Were you aware of that? And how does that feel, it shows the amount of change that you've remained a constant?**

*Yeah, I was aware. Over the years they've slowly started to go and to leave the club. And it's obviously difficult - the club's had lots of change. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a bad thing. If you look at last season, we qualified for this competition, and we went on to achieve two trophies. So I'll definitely say, with all the change, we started probably slow. But last season I think we've come on leaps and bounds.*

**Do you have, like, a WhatsApp group of Champions League winning team? Do you all have something special that ties you together to keep in touch or anything?**

*No, there's no WhatsApp group, but it's always special when we cross paths and see each other.*

**-**

**Preseason last year, you were asked a question \[inaudible\] what your goal for the season was, and you replied, 'to stay on the pitch', in reference to your injuries. Just wondering what your goal for the season this year is - is the same, or is it something different?**

*No, I wouldn't say my goal is the same. I've been on the pitch a while now. I'm feeling good, I'm feeling strong. We want to compete at the highest level, and compete in the Premier League for all the domestic trophies and the Champions League as well. And I believe we have a super strong team, and that will be our targets this season.*

**-**

**I wanted to ask you how strange or interesting is it going to be facing Nicolas Jackson again? He might be kind of directly up against you at times, as well. So how will that feel and what kind of player was he for Chelsea and what kind of player will he be for Bayern?**

*I know Nicolas really well. He's an amazing player. Playing against him will be tough, but on the other hand it will also help me out. I kind of know how he plays.* 

**-**

**Given what you did in the final against PSG, do you think that this team's capable of doing what you did back in 2021 and win this competition?**

*I think it's the start of a new season. It's still early. I have no doubts in the club and the team's ability to go onto compete against the best teams in Europe and in the world, And we will take that week by week, game by game, and see where come at the end of the season.*

**-**

**Just going back to Matt's point about 2021, you've been the last remaining player from that squad. What can you pass on to this group, and what experiences or moments from that campaign can you take to help this one?**

*I think there was probably more to take in the campaigns in which we got knocked out in - last 16, last 8 - I find you learn more when you don't come out on top. I played against these in 2019, I think, or 2020, and they destroyed us, in other words. And days like that, we learn a lot and nights like that will help me going into tomorrow's game.*

**-** 

**Just following up on Nicolas - were you surprised to see him leave this summer, and do you think he's being missed or will be missed?**

*Yeah, I was surprised. I didn't expect him to go. But I think the player wanted a solution, and the club maybe wanted a solution as well. I'm not really sure how the whole situation came about, but no - he's an amazing player. Bayern have got a super good number 9 in him, and I wish him the best - just not tomorrow night.*",70,12,2025-09-17T08:25:50,https://reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1nj7gl4/bayern_munich_vs_chelsea_ucl_prematch_enzo/,2025-09-20T11:50:17.420543

1ngauue,post,champions league,chelseafc,CdrShprd,Brentford 2-2 Chelsea EPL post-match: Enzo Maresca (transcript),"**questions in bold**, *answers in italics*

\- breaks between journalists

(transcribed from TV live; will share links if I can find them)

# Reactions: Enzo Maresca

**Enzo, obviously you'll be very disappointed to have found those two points getting away from you in injury time at the end of the game.**

*Yeah. Yeah, it's a shame, but it's football - can happen. Probably we could, in that moment, we could manage a little bit better - you know, the moment, the game. But yeah, at the end, we concede, and we lost two points.*

**What is the best way to deal with a really dangerous long throw-in? Because long throw-ins are kind of back in fashion, I think. What's the best way to defend it?**

*First of all, if you can avoid throw-in, it's better - probably in the goal we concede, we could also avoid a little bit to concede the throw-in. But then, you know - they have \[Michael\] Kayode, they have \[Mathias\] Jensen, they have \[Kevin\] Schade, even \[Ethan\] Pinnock. So they have many players that they can do that. We did, I think, quite well, unless the goal we concede.*

# Reactions: Enzo Maresca

**How do you reflect on the performance and result?**

*We knew that it was a tough game. First half, we struggle to find solution - we struggle to find the space - because they were defending very good, well-organized. I think, second half, we were much, much better. But yeah, it's a shame, because we concede just in 93, 94 minutes. And we could manage a little bit better that moment.*

**The first goal was a long ball over the top, as well - do you feel that was quite avoidable?**

*Against this kind of team, you have to be able to avoid transition and (laughs) to avoid the set pieces. They score from transition, and from set pieces. It's something that, as I said, I think we deal quite well during the game, but then at the end we concede that goal, and it's a shame.*

**You made significant changes at half-time. What was it you feel you needed to do differently in the second half?**

*No - Wes Fofana, we plan 45 minutes for him because he was out for a long time. Then Hato and Buonanotte, something similar - Hato is coming from different country, different league. He needs to adapt. And Buonanotte, in the last period has not been great for him, because - knowing that he has to go somewhere. But overall, they were ok.*

**It made a difference, though - were you pleased with the way that your team grew into the game and started to create more after that?**

*Yeah, I think second half we were much, much better. We deserve - I think we deserve to win the game second half, but - it's a shame, we lost two points.*

**Cole Palmer's introduction made a big difference. He got his goal, but there was also another big chance after that for him too.**

*Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Long time - almost three weeks out for him. We know how good he is - we know that he's going to help us, and was very good when he was inside.*

**Once you went ahead, do you feel there's anything different you could have done to protect that lead?**

*Manage better. Yeah, manage better the moment. I think we could keep a little bit better the ball, even if we score \[at\] 86, 87 \[minutes\], and with 6 minutes extra time, we need to manage better that moment.*

**It was a big crowd in the box for the long throw which Brentford equalized from. Did you have any complaints about the equalizer? Was something you're unhappy with?**

*No, no, no, no - no, no. I think we deal quite well during the game with set pieces - unless, probably, the goal we concede.*

**Are some balls just - like that, impossible to defend against when there are that many numbers in there?**

*No - but especially when they* have *so many players that can do that - you know, Kayodo can do that, Jensen can do that, Pinnock can do that, and at the end, Schade - so, they have so many players.*

**Before that, there were one or two important saves from Robert Sanchez as well. What did you think of his performance as a whole?**

*And from Kelleher too (laughs). So I think keeper, they are there to try to help the team, to make save, and I think both keeper - they did tonight.*

**It begins an important run of fixtures for you now. It's going to be really busy, and testing for the squad. What shape are you in as a whole?**

*It's for us - it's for everyone. Now we start to play every three days, so for everyone it's a busy moment.*

# [Reactions: Enzo Maresca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orIZvfR6zlc)

**Boss, point on the road. What did you make of the performance tonight?**

*It's a shame. We lost two points. Because when you are winning, 93, 94 minutes, and you concede, you lost two points. I think we struggled first half, for many reasons. Second half we were much better - we score two, we could* score *more. But yeah, at the end, it's a shame.*

**You obviously made changes to the team tonight. How important was that, because you had so many players coming back from international duty late in the week?**

*Yeah, international duty, some of them from injury, some of them, they just arrive two weeks ago. But overall, I think we deal quite well with - you know, set pieces. But at the end we just concede the goal from the throw-in.*

**And you've got players coming back from injury, such as Wesley - Facundo obviously just joining up recently. Was it always the plan to give them 45 minutes?**

*Yeah, yeah, yeah. The plan for Wes, for sure, was 45 minutes. Then we know that, for the ones that they arrive from abroad, it's more difficult. They need to adapt. Jorrel needs to adapt. Buananotte, slowly slowly, is going to help us.* 

**Word on Moises - obviously came back so late in** the **week. 90 minutes, incredible goal. What does that say about his spirit, his attitude?**

*Moi is unbelievable. Probably, as you said, when you arrive Thursday night - just yesterday, first session with us. But he's, in this moment, probably one of the best player in terms of defensive midfielder in the world.*

**Speaking of midfielders, I know you spoke about him at length in your press conference. A word on Enzo - how much is he growing into this team, and the range of passing on display once again tonight.**

*Yeah, Enzo was very good. I think compared to the first two, three games of Premier League, probably tonight he was much, much better. But he knew that. He knew that working day by day he's going to be better and better.*

**Always a tough place to come here, Brentford. Is this the sort of performance, the sort of game you expected tonight?**

*Absolutely, yes. Because we knew how tough and how good they are in terms of transition, set pieces, these kind of things. It's always difficult. I think we deal quite well for part of the game, but unfortunately we concede just at the end.*

**You were able to rest and rotate a few players, obviously, tonight. How important was that with obviously Bayern Munich coming midweek?**

*Yeah, very important. Now, Wednesday is one more game, and then we go Man United away. So, we don't stop.*

# Press Conference: Enzo Maresca

**Enzo, do you think that was a match that was sort of massively impacted by substitutes?**

*For sure. We were much, much better in the second half, for different reasons. We struggled first half. Second half, we scored twice, we could score more, but unfortunately we lost two points in the last two, three minutes.*

**What did you feel about your team selection, because you obviously made three substitutes at halftime, and then you made another one 11 minutes after the half. Are you happy with your team selection - and was it a little bit with Bayern Munich in mind as well?**

*No. We planned 45 minutes for Wes, because it was a long time out. We plan not all the game for Jorrel \[Hato\] because we said already many times - when you arrive from another country, you need time to adapt. Facundo \[Buonanotte\] joined us two weeks ago. Physicality is also not 100%. But we need to manage different situation - like Estevao that was out, Joao Pedro also was not 100%, but he did the effort to play for part of the game. And as I said, second half we were much better.*

**-**

**Enzo, you were - obviously done your homework on Brentford's ability to score goals from long throw-ins, so how disappointing was it not only to lose what you thought was going to be three points so late on, but also that that came from a throw-in?**

*(Laughs) The problem is that they have Kayode, they have Jensen, they have Pinnock, and then Schade at the end. These three players, they were already out - the only one inside the pitch was Schade. And unfortunately, we just concede in the last two minutes - but during the game I think we tried to deal with that knowing that they are so dangerous, because just with (gestures throw-in) they can arrive in the six yard box very easy.*

**And you were just minutes away from winning the game, of course. Do you think that on balance you did enough to win the game today?**

*I think - I think so, yeah. Second half we score twice. We could score two, three more goals. Cole chance, Pedro chance. So (laughs) I think we did enough. Unfortunately, we lost two points just in the last two, three minutes.*

**-**

**What do you think is the most important lesson your team has to learn from this game?**

*For sure, in the moment that we score the second one, we have to manage better. We scored, I think 85, 86, and in that moment you need to give passes, you need to slow down - you need to sleep a little bit the game. Something that we didn't do, and it's something that we need to improve and we need to learn.*

**-**

**Do you think there was any offside over the winning goal - there has been some suggestion that a player, I think it was \[Dango\] Ouattara, was in an offside position and moved towards the ball.**

*I didn't watch back. I ask (laughs) - I ask in the changing room to my coaching staff why the VAR review the second goal, because I didn't watch back, to be honest - I don't know.*

**-**

**I just wanted to ask about Marc Guiu who wasn't in the squad tonight, especially with Liam Delap being out - how do you see his role over the coming weeks?**

*Marc is (laughs) a striker. We know him from last year. He spend all season with us. But in this moment, one of them was out from the squad. I thought also to give Ty a little bit more confidence, because he's doing well - against Fulham he did quite well. Tonight, again, when he was inside he was okay. But the season is so long that for sure Marc is going to find space.*

**And just on Joao Pedro - he sort of played up in the 9, but also dropped behind as well. Wondering how do you see his best position at the moment?**

*I think it's - when we face team that they are low block like tonight, I think having a proper 9 and Joao behind, in the way we play West Ham with Liam and Joao - in the way we start against Fulham with Liam and Joao, it's the perfect situation for Joao.*

**-**

**Can I just ask - you're about to Germany to go face Bayern Munich. Can you explain how that impacted on, especially your first half, performance. It felt contained in some way, as though perhaps you were thinking about the big Champions League night.**

*No, no - no, no. Absolutely - Joao Pedro, before the game, asked me, that he was not fit 100%, better doesn't play. And so if I was think about Bayern Munich, Joao was on the bench. But Joao play because the focus was about tonight. For sure, when ou have so many games, you have to plan different options. For example, Reece James played two games with international team. So, play tonight, and thinking on Wednesday. So it's not - our focus was about tonight, and the reason why is because if this season we play Champions League, it's because we did well in the Premier League, and if we want to play again Champions League next season, we need to do well in the Premier League.*

**-**

**When you had so much ability in Cole, and I'm assuming he's nagging you to 'let me play, I'm fit', how difficult is it for you as a manager to say, 'I've got to take a longer view; you can't just play because you want to play', because you see the impact he made. Is it good that he gives you those problems, or is it quite difficult to deal with them?**

*No, absolutely, but Cole was not fit to play from the start. It's quite easy - it's from the medical staff, it's from the player. It's from - when we take a decision with an \[injured\] player, it's always from all of us. So it's not - when Cole is fit, (laughs) we are very, very happy.*

**It's not fair when he's not fit, then. \[inaudible - both talking\]**

*Yeah, but probably if he start - you know, 90 minutes, is not - when you go inside 20 minutes, half an hour, it's a bit different. But we said many times that with Cole in the team, we are a much, much better team.*",57,85,2025-09-13T22:37:36,https://reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1ngauue/brentford_22_chelsea_epl_postmatch_enzo_maresca/,2025-09-20T11:50:32.904231

Edit: Found the relevant rule:

>31.14c Long-term injury or illness of an outfield player: during the league phase until matchday 6 included, the club concerned may temporarily replace a maximum of one outfield player and register a new outfield player. The club must complete the official registration of List A with the replacement player, who must have been registered with the club in accordance with Paragraph 30.01 to Paragraph 30.06 before the deadline for List A referred to in Paragraph 31.09(e) (i.e. 2 September 2025 - 24:00 CET). An injury or illness of an outfield player is considered long-term if it lasts at least 60 days as of the day the injury or illness occurred. If the outfield player recovers before the end of this 60-day period, the player remains nonetheless not eligible to participate in any UEFA club competition (i.e. UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League or UEFA Conference League), until the end of such period. If the replaced outfield player was registered as a club-trained player or an association-trained player, the quotas for club-trained players or association-trained players must be fulfilled with the replacement. The club must provide UEFA with the necessary medical evidence in one of UEFA's official languages. Before confirming the replacement, UEFA may require further medical examination of the outfield player by an expert appointed by UEFA at the club's expense. Once the injured or ill outfield player is fit to be fielded again, he becomes eligible and/or can resume his position in place of his substitute, who must consequently be removed from the list. The return of the original outfield player must be announced to the UEFA administration at least 24 hours before the next match in which the original outfield player is due to play.",46,0,2025-09-16T08:40:52,https://reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1nibymv/facundo_buonanotte_is_now_showing_on_chelseas/nehpxt3/,2025-09-20T11:50:26.865159

To compound Brighton’s disappointment at Bournemouth last weekend, [**Jack Hinshelwood**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-hinshelwood/) (ankle) and Maxin De Cuyper (knee) were both forced off with injuries in the first half. While Hinshelwood has joined [**Adam Webster**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-webster/) and [**Solly March**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/solly-march/) (both knee) in the treatment room, De Cuyper is a doubt for Saturday, but [**Mats Wieffer**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mats-wieffer/) (knee) and [**Diego Gomez**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-gomez/) (illness) are both fit and available for selection.



If De Cuyper is not deemed fit to start at left-back, then [**Ferdi Kadioglu**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ferdi-kadioglu/) will be expected to earn a place in the back four next to [**Lewis Dunk**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-dunk/), [**Jan Paul van Hecke**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jan-paul-van-hecke/) and [**Joel Veltman**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joel-veltman/), while either [**Carlos Baleba**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/carlos-baleba/) or [**Yasin Ayari**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/yasin-ayari/) is set to replace Hinshelwood in midfield.



[**Yankuba Minteh**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/yankuba-minteh/) has the highest take-on success rate among players with 10 or more attempted in the Premier League this season (65% - 13/20) and the Gambian is set to continue in attack along with Mitoma, [**Georginio Rutter**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/georginio-rutter/) and [**Danny Welbeck**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danny-welbeck/).



As for Tottenham, [**Dominic Solanke**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dominic-solanke/) is “progressing forward"" in his recovery from an ankle injury after returning to training, but Saturday’s contest will come too soon for the striker, who remains sidelined with [**Yves Bissouma**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/yves-bissouma/) (knock), [**Kota Takai**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kota-takai/) (foot), [**James Maddison**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-maddison/), [**Dejan Kulusevski**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dejan-kulusevski/) and [**Radu Dragusin**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/radu-dragusin/) (all knee).



Frank will consider making a couple of changes to his starting lineup, with [**Destiny Udogie**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/destiny-udogie/) back fit and in contention to start at left-back ahead of [**Djed Spence**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/djed-spence/), while deep-lying midfielder [**Joao Palhinha**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joao-palhinha/) will be hoping to force his way back into the first XI at the expense of [**Rodrigo Bentancur**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rodrigo-bentancur/).



[**Richarlison**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/richarlison/), [**Mathys Tel**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mathys-tel/) and Randal Kolo Muani will all battle it out for the centre-forward spot, with the former likely to get the nod, and he could be joined in the final third by [**Xavi Simons**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/xavi-simons/) and fellow summer signing [**Mohammed Kudus**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mohammed-kudus/), although [**Brennan Johnson**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brennan-johnson/) \- who scored in an away defeat to Brighton last season - is ready to earn a recall on either flank.



**Brighton & Hove Albion possible starting lineup:**



Verbruggen; Veltman, Van Hecke, Dunk, Kadioglu; Baleba, Ayari; Minteh, Rutter, Mitoma; Welbeck



**Tottenham Hotspur possible starting lineup:**



Vicario; Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie; Sarr, Palhinha, Bergvall; Kudus, Richarlison, Simons





# Key lines from news conference:

* Frank confirmed that Dominic Solanke remains out injured and will not be available for this game. However, he confirmed the striker is ""back on grass"" and ""has been for three or four days"".
* On when in the season Frank looks at the Premier League table given Spurs could potentially go top this weekend: ""April. I've looked a couple of times. I'm trying to focus on us and our performances. It is so easy to get drawn into something you can't control. The fans can dream and hope. That is what football is all about.""
* He added more on why he only pays attention to what is happening in the moment: ""I'm trying really to focus on our ourselves and our performances and what we can do. It is so easy to get dragged into something you can't control. I also dream and hope but I'm a little bit closer to the action, so I need to stay level-headed and focus on next training because it needs to be perfect.""
* Frank acknowledged the part his full-backs have played so far this season, saying it was a ""privilege"" to have four good ones that are ""performing at a very high level"".
* Spurs have kept four clean sheets in five games this season and Frank said captain Cristian Romero is ""one of the best centre-backs in the world"".
* He added: ""I think he's a great character. He loves his football. He's like a boy sometimes, he loves playing out there with the boys. He loves the game.""

# Pundit Predictions

  
Alan Shearer

I did the Spurs game in the Champions League on Tuesday. It wasn't a great performance, but it was a great result for Thomas Frank's first game as a Champions League manager. I'll go for a **draw** here.



Paul Merson

Tottenham have had a solid couple of games. I knew they would beat West Ham and credit to them for following that up with a win in the Champions League. It wasn't the greatest of performances against Villarreal, but they still got the job done and that's all that matters.

This is the real acid test for Spurs. If they can go to Brighton and win this game, they can finish in the top five this season. It's a chance for Tottenham to go out there and show people they aren't 'Spursy'. I don't want Tottenham fans to feel like I'm being disrespectful because I'm a former Arsenal player, but they can't be beating Manchester City and then losing to the likes of Bournemouth and Brighton!

I think this is a big game and Tottenham have had issues away from home against such teams in the past. I expect a thrilling draw in this one.

**Prediction:** **Brighton & Hove Albion 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur**



**Chris Sutton**

I was at Tottenham's Champions League win over Villarreal on Tuesday for Radio 5 Live, and they were a little bit flat - they only had one shot on target all night, and only scored thanks to an own goal.

Spurs have started the season in a similar way to Liverpool, in that they have not always played that well but most of the time they have still got a result - apart from their defeat by Bournemouth.

What they have in their favour is two incredible centre-halves, in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, who were both phenomenal against Villarreal - Thomas Frank just has to hope he can keep them fit.

Brighton are inconsistent but they are brave and they have some dangerous attacking players. They will take the game to Spurs, and my gut feeling is they will take the win, too.

**Sutton's prediction: 2-1**

1njhbpa,post,champions league,coys,SpookyKuya,Tottenham win shows Thomas Frank has built something Ange Postecoglou never did,"I'm a long time lurker, but thought this was interesting enough to post this bit from the Telegraph. Thom Gibbs reports: An unusual mood swept the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium late in their first Champions League match for two years. [Spurs](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tottenham-hotspur-fc/) held a lucky 1-0 lead and were hanging on against typically gritty Spanish opponents. The final minutes should have been tense, especially for some of the most fatalistic supporters in the country. Instead, oddly, there was calm.

It was, as these things go, a brilliant foul. You absolutely take a yellow card when your team are leading 1-0 with five minutes left. You form a wall and take a deep breath when former Arsenal let-down Nicolas Pépé steps up, booed gleefully all night and ravenous for revenge. Pépé’s free-kick flashed wide and Spurs cruised to the end of the game with unfamiliar serenity.

Even as Pépé stood over the ball it did not seem too terrifying. In Frank’s five games since the start of the Premier League season Spurs have only conceded one goal. They made hay at the other end against West Ham last weekend but looked less potent here.

There were two defining moments in this match, and let us save the fun one for a while longer because it was the sort of game which rationed excitement like wartime sugar. No one will remember tactical fouls in the final assessment of Thomas Frank’s first season, but Micky van de Ven’s quelled nerves and pointed to a saner future.

A long ball sprung the Tottenham defence and put Villarreal striker Georges Mikautadze in on goal. Van de Ven leant on him, heavily and deliberately. By the time the striker came to a stop he was sprawling somewhere close to the six-yard box. He and his team screamed for a penalty but Van de Ven made contact just outside of the area.

1ni9lpd,post,champions league,coys,rahul3103,How Villarreal Plays: Insights from Spanish Broadcaster Phil Kitromilides,"As Tottenham Hotspur prepare to face Villarreal in the Champions League, Spanish football broadcaster Phil Kitromilides shared an in-depth look at the Yellow Submarine—their recent changes, tactical setup, and how they continue to punch well above their weight in European football.

**Squad Overhaul and Transfers**

Villarreal underwent significant changes over the summer, with several key departures. Two of the most notable were **Yeremy Pino**, who joined Crystal Palace, and **Álex Baena**, sold to Atlético Madrid. These were among the most expensive sales in Villarreal’s history, but the club reinvested smartly in the squad thanks to their strong financial management.

They broke their transfer record by signing Georges Mikautadze, the Georgian forward who impressed at Euro 2024, for €30 million. Alongside Mikautadze, players like Ayoze Pérez (formerly of Newcastle and Leicester City) and Nicolás Pépé have been added to bolster their attack. However, many of these players have yet to experience the demands of elite Champions League football.

**Style of Play**

Villarreal’s defining tactical identity underlines pragmatism. They are not a possession-hungry team. Instead, they are happy to surrender the ball and strike on the counter. Kitromilides recalls a La Liga match against relegation-bound Leganés in which Villarreal had just 30% possession but still won 3-0.

This ability to absorb pressure and create high-quality chances on the break was also evident in their recent fixture against Atlético Madrid. Despite losing 2-0, Villarreal produced a higher expected goals tally than their opponents and carved out clear scoring opportunities.

Expect them to take a similar counterattacking approach against Spurs, looking to exploit space left by aggressive pressing or attacking movements.

**Key Players to Watch**

**Georges Mikautadze** – Villarreal’s record signing and the main attacking hope. His pace, directness, and finishing ability make him a crucial weapon on the counter.

**Ayoze Pérez** – Experienced in English football and provides tactical flexibility in the forward line.

**Nicolás Pépé** – Rediscovering form after a difficult spell at Arsenal, he has started the season well with goals and quick contributions.

**Juan Foyth** – A known face for Spurs fans. Once seen as a utility player at Tottenham, Foyth has flourished at Villarreal, evolving into a strong defender and often featuring at centre-back.

**Background and Identity**

Villarreal is perhaps the ultimate example of a club punching above its weight. Based in a town of only 50,000 inhabitants, the team consistently challenges for Europe against vastly larger clubs. Backed by businessman Fernando Roig, owner of Spain’s biggest supermarket chain, the club has remained financially stable while balancing sales and strong recruitment.

Despite their size, Villarreal have a remarkable European pedigree—winning the Europa League in 2021 and reaching the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool in 2022.

**Champions League Mindset**

While they may lack the pressure felt by Real Madrid or Barcelona, Villarreal approach the Champions League as a genuine opportunity. This year’s group is full of giants—Manchester City, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Juventus, and Spurs—which means every point matters. From the club’s perspective, their clashes with Spurs might be seen as one of the more winnable fixtures.

For Villarreal, success in Europe is both a sporting challenge and a source of pride. With limited expectations and less media pressure compared to Spain’s big three, they can play with freedom. When things click—like their magical 2022 campaign—the Yellow Submarine can become one of the tournament’s great dark horses.

**Conclusion**

As Kitromilides explained, Villarreal may not dominate possession, but they are clever, compact, and ruthless on the break. They remain a small-town club competing in football’s elite competition, sustained by smart management, a clear identity, and the belief that European competition is part of their modern DNA.",48,27,2025-09-16T06:05:17,https://reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1ni9lpd/how_villarreal_plays_insights_from_spanish/,2025-09-20T11:51:13.889619

# Team News

Tottenham crushed West Ham at the weekend without record signing [**Dominic Solanke**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dominic-solanke/), who is still nursing an ankle injury and will miss the visit of Villarreal, despite making good progress in his rehabilitation.

Other guaranteed absentees for the Lilywhites are Yves Bissouma, Kota Takai, Dejan Kulusevski, Radu Dragusin and James Maddison - all of whom are both injured and ineligible after being left out of Frank's Champions League squad - while Mathys Tel did not make the cut either owing to Spurs' lack of home-grown players.

The latter led the line against West Ham, but his absence will allow either Richarlison or new signing Randal Kolo Muani to spearhead the charge on Tuesday, where [**Xavi Simons**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/xavi-simons/) should retain his place on the left wing after banking an assist on his Spurs debut at the weekend.

Regarding Villarreal's injury situation, Logan Costa and Pau Cabanes are both on the long road to recovery from ACL issues, while ex-Manchester United defender Willy Kambwala is expected to remain out until December with a hamstring problem.

Gerard Moreno's own hamstring issue means that the experienced striker is also absent, so ex-Arsenal winger [**Nicolas Pepe**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nicolas-pepe/) \- who has just been voted the La Liga Player of the Month for August - could continue up front on his return to the English capital.

Speaking of returning North Londoners, Juan Foyth should start at the back against his old employers, while loanee Manor Solomon is eligible to face his parent club but will likely be kept in reserve.

**Tottenham Hotspur possible starting lineup:**

Vicario; Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie; Sarr, Bentancur, Bergvall; Kudus, Richarlison, Simons

**Villarreal possible starting lineup:**

Junior; Mourino, Foyth, Veiga, Cardona; Pepe, Gueye, Parejo, Moleiro; Perez, Mikautadze

#  Key lines from news conference

* Frank confirmed Dominic Solanke is ""not ready to be involved"" but is ""taking steps in the right direction so that's positive"".
* Randal Kolo Muani is available: ""If we needed him to play, he could play 90 minutes, but can he play at the intensity and the level that we want? But he's ready and he'll be involved, so that's the most important thing.""
* On managing his first game in the Champions League, Frank said: ""It's a fantastic opportunity and experience. It's a big thing. I'm hugely looking forward to it. I know it'll be special when we have that Champions League anthem playing. Now it's preparation, there's a few more cameras, but it's business as usual.""
* More on his personal story: ""I was manager of [Brentford](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford) in the Championship at Griffin Park, a small, compact stadium, and on Tuesday we're playing in one of the best stadiums in the world, in front of our own fantastic fans. It's a European night and we know they'll be absolutely on it. It'll be so special.""
* On how far can Spurs go in Europe: ""I believe I have a fantastic squad and we would like to go as far as possible. I think the most important thing is that it's one game at a time.""
* On the challenge posed by Tuesday's opponents: ""Villarreal are a very good team. I've been very impressed when I've studied them, but we'll do everything we can to get a good start. It's going to be a good challenge.""

# Match Stats

* This will be the first meeting between Tottenham and Villarreal in European competition, with Spurs winning just one of their last 13 matches against Spanish opposition in major European competition (D5 L7).
* Villarreal have played 14 matches against English opponents in the UEFA Champions League and are still looking for their first victory (D6 L8), while losing each of the last seven in a row. Over half of their defeats in the competition have been against English opposition (57% - 8/14).
* This will be third time that Villarreal have played their opening game of a UEFA Champions League campaign against an English side (out of five seasons). The previous two were both against Manchester United and both finished 0-0, in 2005-06 and 2008-09.
* Tottenham have only won their opening game of a European Cup/UEFA Champions League campaign in two of their seven attempts (D2 L3). However, those two have arrived on the last two occasions where they have played their opener at home: 2-0 v Marseille in 2022-23 and 3-1 v Borussia Dortmund in 2017-18.
* Villarreal’s last match in the UEFA Champions League came in the semi-finals of the 2021-22 edition, losing 2-5 on aggregate to Liverpool. The Spaniards won three of their six away games in that campaign (D1 L2), more than they managed in 14 away matches across their three previous appearances in this competition (W2 D5 L7).
* Tottenham manager Thomas Frank will take charge of a team in the UEFA Champions League for the first time – in fact, his only previous experience of managing in European competition came in qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, winning just three of 10 matches with Brøndby IF (D4 L3).
* 42 percent of Tottenham’s goals in the UEFA Champions League (since 1992-93) have been scored by Harry Kane or Son Heung-min (37/89). Following the departures of both, the only current Tottenham player with more than one goal for the club in the competition is Richarlison (2). 
* Villarreal forward Georges Mikautadze has been directly involved in seven goals in eight starts in major European competition to date (four goals, three assists), with all of those coming for Lyon in the UEFA Europa League last season.
* Randal Kolo Muani could feature for a fourth different team (Tottenham) in the UEFA Champions League since the start of 2022-23, having previously appeared for Eintracht Frankfurt, Paris SG and Juventus. No active Champions League player has played for as many as four different teams in this period.
* Villarreal defender Juan Foyth made his UEFA Champions League debut for Tottenham back in December 2017 (v APOEL Nicosia). Indeed, the Argentinean remains the youngest player to start a home game for the club in the competition (19y 328d in that match).

Paris Saint-Germain crushed Atalanta (4-0) in the Champions League, and I made a video focusing on **Nuno Mendes’ key tactical role**.

👉 In this breakdown, I cover:

* How his **deeper positioning created a +1** in PSG’s build-up
* The **constant midfield rotations** that unsettled Atalanta’s man-marking
* Why his movements perfectly fit PSG’s attacking structure
* And the **individual differences** he made in 1v1 situations and ball progression

The video is available in **French and dubbed in English** for international fans 🌍.",13,0,2025-09-18T23:25:22,https://reddit.com/r/psg/comments/1nknpt3/psg_40_atalanta_tactical_analysis_on_nuno_mendes/,2025-09-20T11:51:26.213123

He was on the bench for both finals, but in football all players in the bench are considered winners and he even played in the uefa super cup, so this literaly is another record broken by us.

1niqnl7,post,champions league,fcbayern,kgallo19,"UCL Press Conference Quotes: Kompany, Kane, Marseca, James","Harry Kane on the favourite for tomorrow's game:

> ""We back ourselves to beat any team at the Allianz Arena. It's up to you \[journalists\] and fans to decide who are the favourites. We're feeling very good right now. If we want to beat Chelsea, we have to perform at our peak. It will be a tough and great game. Chelsea did very well at the Club World Cup and right now in the Premier League""

Kane on Uli Hoeneß' statement that Bayern are underdogs in the UCL: 

>""A club like Bayern always expects to win every competition. I wouldn't say we're underdogs, even though we're playing against the best teams in Europe. Now begins a long journey, hopefully until May. I don't want to look too far ahead. We want to be as high as possible in the league phase table. It all starts tomorrow.""

Kane on finishing in the top 8 and avoiding the playoffs: 

>""February 2025 was very difficult, physically and mentally, because we had to play in the playoffs against Celtic. That was a difficult period. But the playoffs don't stop you from success, as PSG showed last season. Of course, we want to finish in the top eight and avoid the playoffs.""

Kane on his goal scoring form: 

>""I always back myself to score goals. I had to get used to everything at a new club and didn't know how well things would go. I'm very happy with how things went and want to build on that. Our style of play suits me well. I have a lot of self-confidence right now and I'm physically and mentally strong. If we're in good form as a team, I'll score a lot of goals.""

Kane on comparing Michael Olise and Cole Palmer: 

>""Two great players. They have a lot of similar attributes Both find the spaces really well, their forward passing is really good, they see runs and through balls - and both score goals. Michael might be a bit more of a wide player that goes into 1v1 and uses his pace, while Cole is more of a number 10 or even as a number 9 that runs in behind and finishes himself. Both are fantastic players. I'm glad Michael is with us and not with them""

Kane on being more involved in the buildup play this season: 

>""When Jamal's not playing, I do drop back a bit. Jamal also creates more chances for the others. Since he's injured, I am dropping back a bit but that also helps because as a number nine, I'm often marked out of the game by opponents. We've not done any special work on that, it's more been dictated by the personnel situation.""

Kane on Nicolas Jackson: 

>""He's been great so far. It was good for him to get 45 minutes on the weekend. He looked sharp and had a couple of half chances. He looked really good in training. He's physically very strong and fast. If he plays tomorrow he'll be eager to impress and get his first Bayern goal. I don't want to put too much pressure on him""

Vincent Kompany on whether he expects Cole Palmer to start tomorrow: 

>""Cole is an outstanding player. It wouldn't surprise me if he starts tomorrow, but they have another game against Manchester United on Saturday so I would also understand if they don't take the risk with him. But I know Cole very well and know he doesn't need a lot of time to have an impact""

Kompany on Uli Hoeneß' statement that Bayern are underdogs: 

>""Let's see what happens. Everyone's 100% up for the Champions League. We want to win the Champions League. There's no Bayern player or coach who would say otherwise. And then there's the reality. Others want that too. We're playing against the best teams in Europe. The only task now is Chelsea, but the dream remains nevertheless""

Kompany on what needs to happen to advance further than last season: 

>""You have to get through the knockout phase first, then anything's possible. We had nine injured players in the last game against Inter and still performed well. With PSG, for example, everyone was fit in the knockout phase. We didn't have that luxury. Obviously we hope for a fit squad so that we always have the best players available""

Kompany on the CL format: 

>""If we win six games, we'll be in the top eight. Four wins are enough for the play-offs. This phase is very interesting. There's a lot of drama in the new format, I think the fans like it. What's still difficult is that every team has different opponents. Our path is tough with Chelsea, Arsenal and PSG, but we want to get into the top eight""

Kompany on whether Nicolas Jackson is ready to start against his parent club:

> ""We'll see tomorrow. I won't reveal too much about the team. You can always look at it from two sides. Of course you're particularly motivated against your ex-club, but it will certainly be a special game for him""

Kompany on Serge Gnabry's form: 

>""Serge has always been a top player. It's not easy to deliver top performances for six or seven years. Maybe he's had a few hiccups. But he has great quality; I believe in him and his strengths. I hope he stays fit and maintains his level. He often performs against English teams, and he'll show that against other teams as well""

Kompany on whether he would ask Nicolas Jackson about Chelsea: 

>""Technically you could, but I've already watched probably 40 games of Chelsea last season. They're an interesting team to obverse. But I don't think there's a lot of mystery around them, and I know the coach very well. I'll quickly see tomorrow whether we've done our homework. But the most important thing is that the players feel good, not that I feel good. That applies to Enzo Maresca's team, too, of course.""

Kompany on last season's injuries in the decisive phase: 

>""Dayot Upamecano, Manuel Neuer, Alphonso Davies or Jamal Musiala have been injured in big games, that's part of it. You also just need luck sometimes. It was looking good for a long while last season, then a lot of things changed during the international break. That affects a season. The belief is there that we'll be lucky this year and they'll be fit when they're needed. We have a lot of players who have had injuries in the past, so we need to be extremely careful.""

 We have the feeling the Bundesliga is not being taken seriously in England, where they call it 'farmers league'. You know both leagues well. How do you see the level of the Bundesliga?  
  
Kompany:

> ""But how many players did they buy from the Bundesliga? How much money did they spend on Bundesliga players? I'm from Belgium, a small country. In Belgium, people always look to other bigger countries and we respect every league. In Germany, people pay a lot of attention to the Bundesliga; in England, they pay a lot of attention to the Premier League. Obviously there's a big financial gap between the Premier League and other leagues. We have to think about how we solve that one day. The Bundesliga certainly has a lot of talent, English teams have bought a lot of players from here. But tomorrow isn't about Bundesliga against Premier League. It's Bayern against Chelsea""

Kompany on whether Tom Bischof at left back could be a long-term option: 

>""Tom has played on the left before. I actually wanted to take Joshua Kimmich off against Hamburg, but then Raphaël Guerreiro said he had to come off. Tom has talent on the ball and a good attitude. It's his first season at the really top level, we're pleased he's here. I think what matters to him right now is minutes, and not the position. It's refreshing to have him in the squad""

Kompany on the left back position: 

>""Josip Stanišić has played on the left and did well, so has Konrad Laimer. Guerreiro will hopefully be back next week. We'll manage it. And Alphonso Davies will also return eventually. It's no good complaining about it. Our job is to deal with situations like this""

Enzo Maresca: 

>""Tomorrow we have the first game against a fantastic team that's probably one of the 3-4 favourites for the competition. But we'll try to do our job in the best way""

Maresca on Nicolas Jackson:

> ""I'm grateful and thankful to him because what we achieved last season was because of all the players, including Nicolas. I texted him after he left the club, thanked him for last season and wished him all the best. Nico is a good guy and was working well""

Maresca on whether he agrees with Uli Hoeneß that Bayern are underdogs in the Champions League: 

>""Bayern Munich is a team that already showed last year that they are very close and can compete to win this competition. This is my personal view. I see them together with 3-4 other clubs as the favourites to win the competition""

Maresca on whether he's concerned Nicolas Jackson could give Bayern insights about his tactics: 

>""Maybe it could be a small advantage. Because he \[Kompany\] can ask Nico about the way we work and prepare. Nico was with us the entire season so he knows exactly the way we approach games. We'll see anyway""

Reece James on Nicolas Jackson:

> ""I know Nicolas very well. He's an amazing player. Playing against him will be tough, but on the other hand it will help me out because I kind of know the way he plays""

Reece James: 

>""To captain the team and walk out at such a historic stadium tomorrow is such an amazing feeling"" 

Reece James: 

>""I played against these \[Bayern\] in 2019 I think or 2020, and they destroyed us, in other words. Days like that we learn a lot. Nights like that will help me go into tomorrow's game""",58,4,2025-09-16T19:08:15,https://reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/1niqnl7/ucl_press_conference_quotes_kompany_kane_marseca/,2025-09-20T11:51:45.451408

# The ""In Case You Missed It"" Thread - for all the highlights we *weren't* paying attention to...

r/soccer is often dominated by discussion around the Premier League, and the biggest European teams. This means other clubs and leagues can get overlooked. The idea for this thread is a ""second chance"" to share goals, highlights, and other news stories that may not have got their deserved spotlight this week.

There are just three rules (as well as all our others about shitposting, trolling etc)

1. No Premier League ""Super League Six"" teams (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City, Man United, Spurs) **OR** Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG or Bayern Munich
2. The original post must have had less than **1,000** upvotes when first posted on r/soccer (if posted at all)
3. If posting a highlight, ensure you share a link to the original r/soccer post, or another source

I have the same feeling.""","The former Juventus player was haunted by the ghosts of his past and recalled a precedent of a harsh penalty awarded in favor of Real Madrid in a match against the Italian team six seasons ago. It was in the 2018 quarterfinals, with Juventus already through, when the referee awarded a dubious penalty in favor of Real Madrid after Lucas Vázquez fell. That moment came back to Benatia because he was the one who committed the penalty. 

When Antón Meana asked him for an explanation of the move, Benatia saw an ""inevitable"" movement in the Marseille defender's body. Despite this, the Moroccan ""wants to focus on the positives"" and pointed out that they must be brave from now on.

> ""I want to focus on the positives, the team's work and the determination of these players. We must improve in the first half because we played with the brakes on, not with fear, but with timidity.

If you’ve watched any of their first group-stage games, how do they look? Can any of them realistically make it into the top 24 / knockout-playoffs?

Here’s what we know so far:

Qarabağ – shocked Benfica with a 3-2 comeback win in Lisbon, after being 2-0 down early.

Kairat Almaty – lost 4-1 to Sporting CP, but honestly didn’t look too bad. They had some really good chances, especially in the second half. (I watched this game)

Pafos – drew 1-1 with Olympiacos, and managed it even with a red card. Pretty impressive for their first ever UCL match.


Questions for you all:

Which of these teams impressed you most so far?

Do you think any of them have a realistic shot at finishing in the top 24?

Could any of them cause some shocks in Europe this season? 

What's your predictions for the matchday 2: Qarabag hosting Copenhagen, Pafos hosting Bayern and Kairat hosting Real Madrid?

[Mikel Merino y Zubimendi celebrando uno de los goles de este último marcado en la última jornada de Premier.](https://preview.redd.it/3ugh5yew8ipf1.jpg?width=3420&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=870aa995930a933661e1804f0e086f6dced08988)

**Vuelve la Champions a San Mamés casi 11 años después** y los leones no están dispuestos a ser el juguete de los hombres de Mikel Arteta. La **ilusión** del conjunto rojiblanco y de sus aficionados junto a la oportunidad de, por fin, hacer algo grande por parte de los ingleses presupone un partido de altura.

A pesar de que el **Athletic** llega tras una derrota en casa y el **Arsenal** con una victoria que dejaba, además, una gran imagen en su juego, lo cierto es que **ambos se plantan en esta primera jornada con un buen comienzo** en sus respectivas ligas, logrando 9 de 12 puntos.

Por parte de los locales, **no podrá contar con Nico Williams ni Beñat Prados**, este último lesionado de gravedad para el resto de la temporada, ni con el recién llegado **Laporte** que sigue entrenando al margen para recuperar su estado de forma. Se espera que el 11 que saque Valverde esté formado por **Unai** en portería; una primera línea con **Yuri y Areso** en los laterales, y **Dani Vivian y Aitor Paredes** en el centro de la defensa; un doble pivote formado por **Ruiz de Galarreta y Jauregizar**; y aquí es donde aparecen las dudas… **Iñaki Williams, Sancet y Berenguer** parecen fijos, sin embargo la plaza que resta en esta primera alineación del Athletic se la disputarán, a priori, entre **Guruzeta y Sannadi**. No se descarta que Iñaki haga de 9 y Valverde prefiera dar entrada a otro mediocampista como Unai Gómez.

El conjunto *gunner* llega algo más mermado de **lesiones,** pues entre sus bajas se encuentran Gabriel Jesús, Ben White, **Odegaard, Bukayo Saka y Kai Havertz**, estos tres últimos especialmente importantes en el esquema de Mikel Arteta. Teniendo en cuenta que al entrenador vasco le gusta rotar cuando se trata de alternar competición nacional y europea, no suele ser fácil adivinar por qué hombres apostará. Aún así, las bajas lo hacen algo menos complejo y la gran plantilla que posee hace que pueda **reconstruir su once inicial sin aparentes problemas** a pesar de dichas ausencias. En portería estará el catalán **David Raya**, acompañado por una línea de cuatro formada por **Timber, Mosquera, Gabriel y Lewis-Skelly/Calafiori;** por delante se presupone la presencia de dos viejos conocidos, pero no queridos en Bilbao, como son **Zubimendi y Mikel Merino** junto a **Declan Rice**; y la línea de ataque estará formada por los recién llegados **Eze, Gyokeres y Madueke.**

La **vuelta a San Mamés** de tres hombres especialmente queridos en **San Sebastián** tras vestir la camiseta txuri-urdin supone un incentivo más a este gran duelo que cualquier cosa puede deparar. **Zubimendi, Merino y Mikel Arteta** se volverán a reencontrar con un ambiente que no será la primera vez que les pite. La baja de Odegaard hace que no sea posible el pleno en dichos reencuentros, contando el noruego también con pasado en el norte de España. Un reencuentro menos tenso será el de **Kepa**, que podrá reencontrarse con su ex afición tras pasar por el Chelsea, Real Madrid y Bournemouth, aunque eso sí, lo tendrá que vivir desde el banquillo.

En este contexto tendrá lugar uno de los dos partidos inaugurales de la Champions League 25/26, un partido de nivel para dar el pistoletazo de salida entre dos equipos que **no se han enfrentado nunca en partido oficial** y será esta la primera vez que lo hagan.

# REAL MADRID-MARSELLA

[Kylian Mbappé vs Real Sociedad](https://preview.redd.it/vd9of3yz8ipf1.jpg?width=3984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c2aaebf20f642bfade44fd58d53d4f6ef4ce658)

El **Santiago Bernabeu** volverá a vivir un partido de su **competición favorita** con las expectativas de recuperar su legado como Rey de Europa el próximo 30 de mayo en Budapest.

Primera gran prueba para el conjunto blanco, que llega en un **buen estado de forma y de resultados**, tras haber conseguido un pleno de victorias en este principio de temporada. Además, cuenta con un Kylian Mbappé en un momento brillante. La **confianza se vio reforzada** en esta última jornada tras conseguir los 3 puntos en San Sebastián tras jugar gran parte del partido con un hombre menos y, aún así, mantener la ventaja y resistir. Los chicos de Xabi buscarán empezar con buen pie su andadura por Europa y resarcirse del mal sabor de boca con el que se quedaron la temporada pasada.

Los franceses, por otra parte, **no han empezado de forma tan solvente** en su respectiva liga, acumulando dos victorias en casa y dos derrotas como visitante. A pesar de este inicio dubitativo, el **Marsella** no es ni mucho menos un hueso fácil de roer y está dispuesto a rascar algún que otro punto de la capital. **De Zerbi**, desde el banquillo, tratará de que sus muchachos pongan en serios problemas a la línea defensiva del Real Madrid, un entrenador que se ha ganado un nombre en Europa y que es bien sabido que le gusta ser **fiel a su estilo**, independientemente del rival.

Se esperan **rotaciones** por parte de **Xabi Alonso**, especialmente de la línea del ataque. Así, **Courtois** estará defendiendo una vez más la portería blanca; esta vez será turno de **Arnold** en el lateral derecho, y el resto de la defensa podría repetir, empezando con **Militao y Huijsen** en el centro de la zaga, y **Carreras** en la izquierda; no se esperan sorpresas en un mediocampo formado por **Tchouameni, Arda Guler y Fede;** y los encargados de batir la meta rival serán, por supuesto, **Mbappé** como pieza fija, y sus acompañantes son la principal incógnita, aunque salvo sorpresa también repetirá **Vinicius** y se presupone la vuelta a la titularidad de **Mastantuono.** A priori, **Rodrygo** seguirá viendo a sus compañeros desde el banquillo.

Cabe destacar dos grandes noticias positivas como son la vuelta a una convocatoria por parte de **Jude Bellingham y Camavinga**. La vuelta de estos dos hombres importantes en la medular tienen especial relevancia en estos momentos de la temporada, donde la lesión de tres meses de Rudiger y la sanción de dos partidos de Huijsen en competición liguera, puede provocar que el míster blanco tenga que tirar de un Tchouameni de nuevo como central en los próximos partidos.

Por parte de los hombres de De Zerbi, el italiano no podrá contar con dos de sus nuevos fichajes, **Aguerd y Traoré.** Por ello, según *L’Équipe*, el once será reestructurado con un viejo conocido de La Liga en portería, **Rulli;** en defensa tratarán de parar la dinamita blanca con **Murillo, Pavard, Balerdi y Emerson;** en el centro del campo estarán **Gomes, Hojbjerg y Kondogbia;**  y en la línea de ataque, liderada por **Aubameyang,** y partirán desde las bandas **Greenwood y Weah.** 

Xabi Alonso y sus pupilos intentarán seguir construyendo sus engranajes que poco a poco van cogiendo forma, a la vez que el conjunto francés buscará dar un golpe sobre la mesa y despejar dudas en cuanto la imagen dada en su inicio liguero. 

# TOTTENHAM-VILLARREAL

https://preview.redd.it/58s8j4m29ipf1.png?width=3683&format=png&auto=webp&s=682bc58452563b0426ec3d84538718c109ff8b87

El **submarino está de vuelta** en la competición más laureada del mundo del fútbol y su primera parada será el norte de Londres. Las **ilusiones** de estos clubes que no todos los años tienen la suerte de disputar este tipo de encuentros parece que siempre se ven impulsadas todavía más cuando se trata de torear en **plazas de este calibre** como son los feudos de los conjuntos de la **Premier League**. 

Un **nuevo Tottenham** de **Thomas Frank** parte como favorito en este primer gran duelo y pretende imponerse poniendo sus cartas encima de la mesa para recuperar el respeto perdido en Europa. El conjunto londinense **ha comenzado bien su temporada liguera**, ganando tres partidos, uno de ellos en el Etihad Stadium ante el Manchester City, y perdiendo tan solo uno. También viene de realizar un gran partido ante el PSG en la Supercopa de Europa, a pesar de acabar perdiéndola en los penaltis. Aunque la baja de **Son** en verano se presuponía sensible, han acabado reforzándose de forma notable con las incorporaciones de **Xavi Simons, Kolo Muani, Kudus y Mathys Tel.** A estos hombres se le suman los ya pertenecientes a los Spurs, **Brennan Johnson, Kulusevski, Solanke, Maddison** y compañía, componiendo así una línea ofensiva que puede provocar serias pesadillas en los equipos rivales. 

Ahora bien, como ya sabemos y hemos vivido y revivido tantas veces en el fútbol, especialmente en su máximo nivel europeo, nada tiene que ver los nombres de las camisetas con el funcionamiento posteriormente del equipo. Y menos todavía en las grandes noches de Champions League. El conjunto liderado por **Marcelino** tratará de **dar la sorpresa** con un bloque compacto, solidario y trabajador. La Liga **había comenzado bien** para el combinado amarillo, con dos victorias en casa, una de ellas de forma contundente ante el Girona. Sin embargo, la cosa **se torció** en un **fatídico minuto 94 ante el Celta** en Balaídos, y un **encuentro bastante pobre** ante el Atlético en el Wanda Metropolitano. Es por ello que el Villarreal buscará volver a la senda positiva y recuperar la buena imagen de los dos primeros partidos.

Marcelino va a a sacar su **mejor once** en el Tottenham Stadium (obviando la baja de Gerard Moreno) e irá con todo a por este **duro debut** en una competición en la que no hay margen de error. En la portería seguirá **Luiz Junior,** respaldado por una defensa formada por **Mouriño, Foyth, Rafa Marín y Sergi Cardona;** a partir de aquí está la duda de si seguirá con un doble pivote, dos hombres abiertos en banda y dos puntas, o si reforzará el centro del campo añadiendo un centrocampista más. Lo que está claro es que **Gueye y Comesaña** serán sus timones en el centro del campo, junto con **Moleiro y Pépé,** donde la posición de estos dependerá del sistema que elija el míster. En punta estará **Mikautadze,** en principio junto a **Ayoze.**

Thomas Frank, por su parte, no podrá contar principalmente con Kulusevski, **Mathys Tel (no está inscrito en Champions)**, Solanke, Maddison ni Bisouma. Con estas circunstancias, el once esperado estará formado por **Vicario** en portería; una defensa de cuatro consolidada como es la compuesta por **Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Van de Ven y Udogie,** que volvería a la titularidad; en el medio podría volver también **Bentancur** acompañando a **Palhinha** y a **Bergvall;** y en las bandas, los recién incorporados **Simons y Kudus** formarán el ataque junto con **Richarlison.** Una opción bastante probable también es la entrada de **Brennan Johnson** en banda y otorgarle la posición de 10 a Simons, mandando a la banqueta al jóven Bergvall.",1,1,2025-09-16T10:37:25,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nidvv4/previa_champions_league_1609/,2025-09-20T11:52:41.611827
1niaafu,post,real madrid,ChampionsLeague,kubaqzn,Is there less excitement about the Champions League today than ever?,"Pretty much the question in the title. In the past I remember being genuinely excited when the Champions League started around. Now it begins today and I don't feel anything. Neither do most of people I know.

Now, one key aspect is the country I'm from. I'm from Poland and no team from my country plays in this and won't play in it unless we ""scam"" our way to 10th place in UEFA rankings or get lucky draw in 2-3 years when our Champion will be in Q4 (unless access list changes). Meanwhile 4 our teams are in Conference League and that generates hype. But I think there is more.

Another aspect is that people get older and generally as you age, you excite less about everything. But then again there are moments in football hyped to oblivion. Or maybe there is something else.

And when I was scrolling on Twitter I found another round of discussion whether a switch to a League format was a good idea. There are people who hate this and prefer old group stages. Yet when you look how uneventful last groups stages were it makes you wonder. And I figured it out.

We don't miss the old Champions League format because of the format itself. We miss the time when top European teams weren't as far apart from the rest as they are today. In the 2003/04 season (the first with single group stage and 16-team knockouts) there were 2 groups that had difference between 2nd and 3rd team of 3 points or more. Fast forward 20 years and that number jumped to 6. Not to mention the final was Porto - Monaco. Now either reaching the quarterfinals would be a miracle.

Speaking of Quarterfinals - in the last 11 seasons out of 88 spots, it went to about 30 unique teams. And out of those 30 teams, 6 of them (PSG, Manchester City, Bayern, Atletico, Real Madrid, Barcelona) hog 45 of them.

Champions League turned into league of the few with everyone else being cannon fodder. So no matter the format, this component stays. And will stay because no one has an interest in making changes.

I expect this post to be downvoted to oblivion. I don't care. Needed to get out of my chest. But we do live in the sad times when it comes to the Champions League. And I have no idea how to fix it...

1ni3k47,post,real madrid,ChampionsLeague,aboss101,"Arsenal fans hyping up CL quarters and semis is embarrassing — football is about winning, not “progress”","Arsenal are the only so-called “big club” where this nonsense about “trust the process” gets hyped up. Other clubs bring in managers and demand trophies straight away — you either win or you’re gone. That’s the reality of elite football.

But at Arsenal? Fans celebrate league finishes and hype up reaching Champions League quarters or semis as if that means anything. It doesn’t. The only progress in elite sport is lifting silverware. End of story.

Other clubs don’t lower the standards. Real Madrid, Bayern, City, Barca, even Chelsea in the past — they sack managers who don’t win. No one cares about “we finished 2nd” or “we got to the semis.” The game is about trophies, not league positions or vibes.

So why is it only Arsenal fans who accept this loser mentality?",0,18,2025-09-16T00:54:58,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1ni3k47/arsenal_fans_hyping_up_cl_quarters_and_semis_is/,2025-09-20T11:52:43.364154

neg5hkh,comment,real madrid,ChampionsLeague,Key_Cartoonist5604,,"This guy is absolutely seething that Arsenal isn’t sacking Arteta. It’s embarrassing.

When the man took over, the club was in eighth, it was much like how Man United’s been these past years. We very well could be where Man United fans are stood right now. Man United had this mentality. Success now. Success now. They sacked manager after manager time and time again when they didn’t deliver results and that go them nowhere. 

Arsenal isn’t like that. They put trust and faith into one man, they gave him time. That one man got eighth twice in his first two seasons. They held firm and now? 3 Seasons of consecutive second place finishes and a champions league semi-final. We’ve been so close each and every time. Did we win? No. Would we like to? Yes. Is our best chance of doing so with Arteta? Ding ding ding.

We gave PSG a game last year. This year we have the best squad depth in the Premier League and for the third year in a row, the best defense in all of Europe. I have full faith this year we will win one of either the Premier League or the UCL.

Where is Man United? If not for Arteta, we’d be where Man United is now or worse.

He’s been an incredible squad builder.
He’s been an incredible in-game manager.
He’s been unlucky with injuries.

Who could we bring in that would do, without any doubt, better than Mikel Arteta? Ten hag? Pochettino? Xavi? I don’t trust that.

necd42l,comment,real madrid,ChampionsLeague,Remarkable-Smoke6138,,I think Bayern's front three is up their. I have seen all their bundsliga games so far but the way their attacks links together is crazy. They have brought in Luis Diaz who is an upgrade on sane and Colman. They also have a good backup striker in Nicolas Jackson. This is Bayern who are missing two crucial player already looking great and as a trio have scored the most goals with Gnabry also Turning it up notch as well. I am saying this as Liverpool fan who's attack is good on paper but have struggled in the low blocks of Burnley and Arsenal are tough game.,13,0,2025-09-15T13:31:30,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nhkn8u/which_team_has_the_best_attack_as_of_202526/necd42l/,2025-09-20T11:52:45.110571

1nl4fcl,post,real madrid,realmadrid,InsanePheonix,Some stats for our matches so far ..,"This is our field control compared to a few of our upcoming opponents :

[Purple is the area where each team dominates, Pink is the area where the opponents dominate the pitch. \(Data from OptaAnalyst\)](https://preview.redd.it/0kmgbgi6n4qf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bef158a6ff34fe92623eb3df7213a1c631810d5a)

From what I see:

* our RW is still very weak
* our midfield is kinda still shaky
* Barca and Liverpool still dominate a lot of the pitch
* Man City is in shambles

[Other than that lets have a look at Opta's LaLiga stats](https://theanalyst.com/football/team/scm-186/real-madrid/stats)

**As a team :**

* We are underperforming our xG (G v xG = -0.57)
* We lead in Successful Pass % & Successful Final 1/3 passes (net and % both)
* PPDA is among the lowest(which is a good thing, but the best is still Barca), meaning we still need to refine our pressing sequences (we are allowing the opposition to pass the ball around more before we commit to a defensive action)
* We have among the highest shot ending and goal ending pressing sequences(net and % both)
* We have attempted more buildups and direct attacks than any team in the league
* Defensively we have won the highest amount of ground duels, we are top 3 in GA vs xGA
* Barca still allows less touches in the box to their opponents than us(48 vs 75) and face way less shots against them (26 vs 40)

**Individually** :

* Arda, Dean, Carreras, Fede and Tchouameni are the best passers in the team(in terms of open play passes attempted & success %)
* Arda and Carreras lead in Final 1/3 passes
* Tchouameni is rock solid as a CDM, he leads in Ground Duels Won(13/16) and Aerial Duels(11/15). Dean is solid aerially as well (12/17)
* Dean leads in ball carries, Vini at #2, Carreras is at #3
* [Arda and Kylian have created the most chances this season so far](https://www.statmuse.com/fc/ask/most-chances-created-this-season?l=eu5)

[Guler x Mbappe is the new Ozil x CR7 ?](https://preview.redd.it/z3jyaxkgn4qf1.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=64bf9cd2d981b4117186f2287b860e2163e4e8b4)

[Attacking Sequence Involvements in top 5 leagues so far](https://nitter.net/OptaAnalyst/status/1969018479056470196#m) :

* 3/10 players are Madridistas
* Carreras is a gift
* How did we miss out on Olise?
* Fede's new role is usually up for discussion & criticism these days, the stats seem to suggest otherwise, many fans say he has lost his spark

NOTE :

* I know Barca has faced ***considerably*** weaker opposition so far, and the Violencia game is an outlier that kinda skews the data in their favour a lot
* We played \~60 mins as 10men vs LaReal
* Although this is too early into the season to judge teams solely based on stats(I believe stats give out a more balanced picture only after around 10 matches), the eye test is still kinda valid and the stats fit with what we see on the field.
* [Take the numbers, such as duels won or carries or dribbled past, etc. with a grain of salt, these numbers are often miscalculated and often misrepresent the quality](https://x.com/Hennes_4/status/1728541660194156883)

He was inconsistent, yes, but on his day he could score from anywhere and everywhere, out of nowhere. He was a beast. We all say injuries ruined his career and yes, it did but Bale's time here should be regarded as much more than a 'what if' situation.

    Trent         militao                 Dean      Carreras 
                                 Tchoumeni 
 
                   Valverde               Camavinga

                                  Belligham 
     
                        Mbappe          Vini 


1. Tibu obvious reason why best goalkeeper itw

2. Trent again pretty obvious why helps build from the back has amazing passing ability and can make passes directly to Mbappe/vini. And his defense is nowhere near as bad as they wanted us to believe.

3. Militao at his best injury free arguably the best defender ITW he’s strong, fast, athletic, good heading ability, and has decent ball playing ability  

4. Dean amazing ball playing ability, helps build from the back, press resistant, has great defense

5. Carreras literally the perfect LB has everything attack and defense, good on ball, good positioning

6. tchoumeni our defense literally does not exist without this guy and he’s capable of inverting between CB and CDM depending on the situation and formation 

7. Camavinga literally offers everything Xabi would ever want. press resistant, elite ball carrier, passes between the line, creative, capable/shown flashes of controlling tempo, consistently keeps the ball moving, great defense, disturbs the opposing team build up, great interceptions and anticipation he offers so much nobody else on this team offers (I believe he is capable of being our deep lying playmaker given the time to nurture into it he and Kross shared that role back during that 2023 season when they were both in the game ) 

8. Valverde there is no Real Madrid without Valverde and I think in a lineup where he won’t have to cover ardas defensive liability’s he can play a lot more like himself and help the attack  

9. Jude is crucial to our attack and creativity there is a reason he gets the assist, amazing ball winner, engine, amazing defense, press resistant, literally the perfect complete midfielder I don’t have to explain why

10. Vini even though vini has been bad putting him in a front 2 where he won’t get pushed to the sideline as much will help him he will be forced to cut in more often and will be given more 1v1 opportunities with the field being less cramped 

11. Mbappe don’t have to explain this one  


Subs:

Arda: when we play sides that like to sit back and have a slow and less physical midifled arda would be perfect to break down those deep lying teams.

Carvajal: complete RB if we need more defense he can be brought on 

Drahim diaz: amazing dribbling ability if we need goals or to create some disruption he is always the perfect sub 

Rudi: if we need more defense he’s old but if he fully recovers he’s still capable of being one of the best around

Asencio: if we need defense he’s young and he’s pretty good on the ball 

Franco: again if we need more attack similar to brahim Diaz he creates chaos has great dribbling ability bring a new dynamic to the team. 

Endrick: if we need someone who likes to stay in the box has a crazy powerful shot and is very energetic

As much I love both of them and what they achieved here in Real Madrid, I think it's time to say goodbye to them. It's clearly obvious that Xabi alonso does not see them as long termed player's anymore. Whether its rodrygo getting limited minutes or vini getting subbed off, it's clear to everyone that he's not truly convinced by them. If you take a look at both recent form it's just not what it was back in the days. Vini doenst look like the vini we know because he keeps loosing the ball and making poor decisions while rodrygo just doesn't  really impact the game. In the offenses it's just mbappe doing all the work. I don't really know how much I can take seeing vini getting rage baited by other players and rodrygo doing absolutely nothing. I think the only way for Madrid to dominate all of Europe and all competitions is to move mbappe to his preferred position in the left and having an actual striker. To end my thoughts, I know I might get called a fake fan or whatever but as someone who works a shitty job while going to college, watching Madrid playing football is what excites me but I'm tired of seeing a team not playing in a convincing way but that's just me.",0,41,2025-09-18T05:57:48,https://reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1nk0d9v/we_need_to_have_a_serious_talk_about_vini_and/,2025-09-20T11:53:09.260463

1njmvh9,post,real madrid,realmadrid,DonuandDeca,(Long read) I think Arda Guler will adapt into the deep midfield as years go by,"I know it's a slightly long read, but please feel free to read and add anything you like. Remember, this is just my opinion, not an attack on you or your personal thoughts lol.

I think Arda Guler will become our next Kroos but I can't prove it yet. I know that no one can replace Toni Kroos, yet we can still have a similar profile of player. Arda's current attack-oriented role seems fine for now, but I feel like he'll fit the deep midfield better as time goes on because of his attributes:

Arda has great technique and great game vision with excellent set-piece taking ability. However he is slow, and defending isn't his strong point. He can become the brain of the team as the years go by. As you know, the brain needs extra protection, which, in this metaphor, would be his teammates.

A midfield consisting of 3-4 players should be balanced with the different profile of players, and I think we'll have that in the upcoming years:

Tchouaméni is the tank, the holding midfielder, the aggressor (like Gattuso, like Casemiro), Fede is the lungs, the Swiss knife and the engine (like Gerrard, like Seedorf), Jude is the box-to-box attacking threat (like Lampard, like Bruno), and Arda is the elegant playmaker (right now he's more like Ozil, but he could be like Pirlo or Kroos as time goes, which is the point of my post). I think he fits deep midfield better, where his work rate won't matter as much since he'll be surrounded by some of the most resilient players in the world. Right now he's the creative outlet that occasionally gets exposed because of his weaknesses.

Of course, if he wants to play deeper, he'll need to avoid any lapse of judgement like yesterday's disaster of an error against Marseille. He'll need to shield the ball well, make no simple passing errors, check his shoulders, always find the right pass etc. He showed he can do it before, but perfecting this role at 20 is very difficult, and I think both Xabi and the staff are willing to give him time to learn new things. I think he'll slowly be tailored to play deeper and in a few years' time, he'll become the brain of the team, dictating play and becoming the set-piece specialist too, like Kroos.

What do you think? Do you think he'll stay as more of an attacking option throughout his Real Madrid career, or will he learn how to be the deep tempo-setter, passing hub/playmaker and improve in that direction?

1njfkiq,post,real madrid,realmadrid,IcefoxX5,"[Match Thread] Real Madrid Castilla - Racing de Ferrol | Primera Federación, Matchday 2","#FT: CASTILLA 0:1 FERROL

&#x200B;

#1ª FEDERACIÓN

&#x200B;

**Scorers/replays:** 

0:1 Pascu 45'+5

&#x200B;

**match updates:** 

1' - Kickoff, vamos! 

9' - Ferrol have received a penalty, but missed - I am still searching for a way to watch the match 

11' - I have found a stream and Ferrol score, but Arbeloa asks for the review - the goal gets cancelled for offside. Turns out, there was no penalty, my live score app showed the goal ruled out as a missed penalty mistakenly

12' - a Ferrol player is injured but our players refuse to kick the ball out. When the game is stopped, their players go after ours and start a fight, the referee have 2 yellow cards, but I wouldn't be surprised if Arbeloa asks for another review for a red card

15' - despite the review showing a CLEAR elbow into the face of Joan, the referee decides it's no red card, even after he gets shown the incident on the screen - I am speechless at this point

38' - Castilla now controlling the match to their liking and working hard for the first goal, Ferrol busy defending

⚽ 45'+5 - Goal for Ferrol, Cristian David defends Pascu so badly that he can take a shot directly from the corner kick, he hits it nicely with the inside of the foot, leaving Fran without a chance 

HT - well, that's one way to throw a half into the gutter where you controlled a big part of the match - the team had lots of dangerous possession but failed to generate much actual danger, and Ferrol punish them late on

46' - 2nd half underway, let's turn this around and prevent the negative trend

🔄 58' - Triple sub by Arbeloa - Fortea, Palacios and Yáñez for David, Pol Fortuny and Loren Zúñiga

🔄 69' - Roberto Martín comes on for Bruno Iglesias

🔄 78' - last sub as the 4 earlier subs did not bring any improvement - Jacobo Ortega comes on for Cristian David 

84' - Dani Yáñez cuts inside and shoots from the edge of the box, just wide - the first and only chance for Castilla in the second half so far

90'+2 - Yáñez skies a shot in the box after a good dribble and cross from Fortea

FT - back to back losses for Castilla - a very disappointing performance by Arbeloa's team today, despite lots of possession and control, I don't think they had a single shot on target. Rachad Fettal's absence weighs heavily, and in general, there was no player who could make the difference in attack today

nf45byj,comment,real madrid,realmadrid,jedifolklore,,"That’s some proper analysis, a nice change a pace from the negativity the sub easily shared sometimes. 

I do think football analysis on most popular fan discussion spaces is not based on actual analysis but rather mixed in a series of buzzword like “washed”, “cooked”, “ass” to create or generate clicks or traffic. You mix in stats that some fans misuse and it gives it a little of credibility. If the account has millions of followers the better. 

6/10 fans don’t analyze games or learn about positioning anyways, they need to be told how to like a player or if the player is ‘sexy’ with the way they play their football, that’s when they react to him/her. 

In turn, most fans repeat what they read on these popular sites because its content that’s already been ‘digested’ and now it’s ready to be regurgitated.

nezjng7,comment,real madrid,realmadrid,ZebrawithStripe,,"I feel like you are trying to justify in your head to sub off Arda for Cama. Especially the way you contradict yourself with both statements. You are telling me, Camavinga, who has been in this team since 2021, who has been in this team, for FOUR YEARS, not one, not two, not three, FOUR YEARS, needs MORE TIME TO DEVELOP, to a position he ALREADY PLAYS IN? And sacrifice Arda's much NEEDED game time for a more injury-prone player? Mind you, this is Arda's FIRST year playing as a starter and first year IN RM, not fenerbahçe, to play as a CAM/DLP, because lo and behold Ancelotti had a breakthrough in finding out that Arda, was actually a midfielder, and not a winger! What a shocker!

Where do you think those ""weak physicality"" statements were coming from? At what time? Why do you think he suddenly became more productive in the team, AFTER he switched to CAM/CM? Because the man in charge, the gaffer, Mr. DON CARLO himself put him in RW at the time, before he ""experimented"" him in CAM, which is already his NATURAL position! It's like taking away an important feature of a product, and then introducing it when it should've been there in the first place!

You are calling Cama to develop as a DLP, when you literally call Arda, ""perfect to break down those deep lying teams."" THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT DLP's PURPOSE IS! ARDA IS A DLP. CAMA IS NOT. You are trying too hard to discredit Arda while also hilariously failing at it at the same time.

And Arda is a attacking midfielder. And does the DLP job whenever he has to. He can do both. Why does Arda have the same amount of assists as Mbappe? Why break that partnership between those two, which is paying off very well as they both complement each other, for someone like Cama? Arda is literally on top of assists charts, already has one MOM, bags goals whenever he has to, is always prominently on the score sheet, like what more do you want this kid to do? It's honestly shameful the amount of slander you guys put him through, just because he didn't really have a good game last game.",2,0,2025-09-19T00:36:49,https://reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1nkaukf/how_i_would_lineup_going_forward_and_why/nezjng7/,2025-09-20T11:53:02.924153

That makes any such material child pornography by definition, regardless of the minor’s apparent consent. Therefore, the responsibility lies with those who recorded and initially distributed the video, not with Asencio, who btw according to investigation received it as a one time view video FROM A THIRD PERSON. The fact that she is underage eliminates the legal argument of voluntary participation she is legally prohibited from producing or distributing such material, and so are any third parties.

neuz9ro,comment,real madrid,realmadrid,nmgoesreddit,,"Can we curse? I hope so. Because reading this thread makes me wanna crash out so bad. 

I don’t even know where to start, but let me say this, I hate, like deeply hate, these new age Real Madrid fans. If we can even call them that.

Yeah, Rodrygo and Vini are in a slump, no denying it. But people act like they just showed up yesterday. These two came here when they were barely legal, and we literally watched them grow into top players. More than that, they became part of the Real Madrid mythos. Their names are forever tied to this club’s history.And still, respect is nowhere to be found. unfortunately it is in this clubs DNA to disrespect players or former players. 

About these new age Madrid fans most of them jumped on in the 2020s bandwagon it’s so obvious , when we were winning the UCL every other year. 

You guys didn’t live through the 2000s or the early 2010s. You probably didn’t witness the 12 year drought after 2002. I bet you lot don’t even know that before the UCL victory in 1998 we went 33 years without winning it. Two whole generations grew up without seeing this club lift the trophy.

Me? I was part of the 12 year drought generation. I watched Madrid get humiliated in Europe year after year. Liverpool in 09, Lyon in 10, Arsenal in 06, the 6:2 against Barcelona. I’ve seen this club at its lowest. That changes your perspective.

When Cristiano left, we lost 40 to 50 goals a season. 
Not only that it was the last time this club scored 90 or more goals in La Liga. Benzema stepped up eventually, but let’s not rewrite history. He wasn’t always loved. He came in 09 with Cristiano, scored 8/9 goals in La Liga in his first season while Higuaín bagged 27 and CR7 26, People wanted him gone after a few seasons not deemed good enough to lead the attack. Especially for those who only think of Benz in 2020s not his entire career and the Benzema fan club that run this narrative that he sacrificed himself for CR7 which I always had a problem with because it was evident from the very first start that these two players were goin to operate on different levels and that’s not a dig at Benz.

Modrić, now a legend more than a legend , was labeled the worst transfer in La Liga. People wanted him and Kroos gone after that Ajax game in 2019 and these players delivered two more UCLs. In their mid 30s ffs 



CR7-GOAT himself, the greatest player we’ve had in the  21century, got booed when his form dipped. So ask yourself, if these new age fans were around back then, would they have said sell Cristiano, sell Modrić, sell Kroos every time they didn’t perform ?(because I know a lot of y’all would have, because yall couldn’t have survived this club in the last decade)

And the obsession with Rodrygo’s La Liga goal tally? That’s rich and hilarious. Look at Di María, Özil, Figo even Zidane almost all identical numbers, “but Rodrygo played here longer” what about Isco? “Crickets”. This is for those who will respond with what about assists i specifically mentioned goals because you guys have been raging about his goal output for a hot minute and not his assists. 

Nobody disrespected them like this. So clearly the hate towards Rodrygo and Vini has reasons outside football, and only God knows why. For those who claim It’s criticism it’s not its hate. I also wonder, who exactly are you replacing Vini and Rodrygo with? I’ve already heard names like Olise as a Rodrygo replacement, so I checked his contract. He is tied until 2029 with no release clause apparently. He is Bayern’s best player as of now , and if we go after him he will either be 27 by the time his contract ends, or we would have to cough up 150 to 200M to get him. 

If Isak and Wirtz went for sums in that region, and Olise keeps performing like this, we are probably looking at breaking a transfer record, maybe even Neymar’s. Because let’s be real, signing players at their peak from Bayern, bar Toni Kroos, is always an adventurous task and not sure Florentino fancies that with his new transfer policy of getting players on a free. 

Here’s the reality, this club always bounces back. Always. History backs this up. We went 33 years without a Champions League in the last century then another 12 in this century. That’s 45 years combined where countless people who called themselves Real Madrid fans never saw the club lift the trophy. Rest in peace to all of them. To every mother, father, grandfather, grandmother, son and daughter that called themselves Real Madrid fans and never got to see this glory, remember that we are the lucky ones who got to witness greatness so be grateful.

So yeah, stop throwing tantrums like spoiled brats because Vini and Rodrygo don’t score 560 goals every week or assists or beat defenders 1 on 1 every fucking time. New Manager, new era, new methods to playing football it will all take time to click if you can’t be patient for a few months fuck it a year even then this club might not be suited for you because we suffered for real and we still here.

nevmwd3,comment,real madrid,realmadrid,MadGaemer,,"Vini seems to be having problems fitness wise, we all saw his speed has reduced significantly.  
He likes to play isolated on the left and take 1v1 duels, but teams have learned how to defend against him, when he has the ball, 2-3 players defend close to him.  
He will continue to struggle, unless the system is improved in order for him to either receive more help, or to draw away more defenders from his area.

As for Rodrygo, his role was different compared to Vini>  
Rodrygo had to drop down to defend, a lot, and that made a huge difference when we came against good team, that required us to defend more.  
He also played out of position on the right side, similar to Bale when we signed him. I\`m pretty sure we can all agree that Bale would have performed a lot better if he was used on the left.

Overall, both Vini and Rodrygo are world class players, they\`ve shown that numerous times, the main issue now is the fact that problems from the Ancelotti era, have not been fixed yet.",6,0,2025-09-18T12:46:19,https://reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1nk0d9v/we_need_to_have_a_serious_talk_about_vini_and/nevmwd3/,2025-09-20T11:53:09.788061
neucm06,comment,real madrid,realmadrid,MekotheSaurus,,"This sub isn't ready to have that conversation. Its full of both player's fanboys and nostalgics of the Friendship FC season. 


Rodrygo hasnt scored in La Liga since January and his last goal in the UCL was against Atlético. He's still riding his goals against City. Eventually he will score a banger and his fans will be happy for the next 6 months, thats how low is the bar for them.


Vini doesnt want to extend and he's probably looking to leave on a free. And the situation looks dire because there's no way RM raises the offer with these performances . Quite the opposite. 


At this point i think Xabi should ditch 4-3-3 and bench both players.

# Match Facts

1. Barcelona have not lost any of their last 10 matches against Valencia in LaLiga (W8 D2), their second-best unbeaten run against Los Che in their history in the competition, after a run of 13 matches between 2007 and 2013 (W9 D4).
2. Valencia have conceded at least one goal in each of their last 21 away games against FC Barcelona in LaLiga (60 goals in total, an average of 2.8 per game), since a 1-0 win in October 2003 under Rafa Benitez, their worst current run without keeping a clean sheet against the same opponent in the competition.
3. Barcelona won 7-1 in their last home game against Valencia in LaLiga, their biggest ever win against Los Che in the competition.
4. Barcelona have won nine of their 11 home games in LaLiga in 2025 (D1, L1), with only Real Madrid (10) having won more home games in the competition since the start of the year.
5. Since the arrival of Carlos Corberán in January 2025, Valencia have picked up points in eight of their 11 away games in LaLiga (W2 D6), although they lost their last one (0-1 vs Osasuna on MD2). Los Che have yet to lose consecutive away games in the competition under the Valencian coach.",28,119,2025-09-14T04:53:31,https://reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/1ngia3u/prematch_thread_barcelona_vs_valencia_cf_laliga/,2025-09-20T11:53:20.122363

nf2d1bv,comment,real madrid,Barca,CruyffCule,,"VIP validation is linked to it but this drop has to be about matchday revenue as this formula is likely based on using Cruyff stadium due to Camp Nou only recently (and partially) given the green light. It has no impact to current squad as it will change in February but it absolutely handcuffs the club in the January window should they pursue a target. Question is if they are up to 60k attendance in October and the VIP seats are validated

1nghtc2,post,real madrid,MCFC,Brilliant-Welcome-32,Problems that need to be addressed ASAP,"So well, since I was really frustrated before the Norway and Belgium matches, I decided to sit down and really think about what has been going wrong in the team. And these are the observations I've made. 


​Pep's Philosophy: Pep  has a well-established and successful system . He has also stated that while the fundamental system remains, he does make changes to smaller details like in the build-up patterns or pressing

​""Rhythm"": The current direction football is going is highly focused on rythym. Who has the rythym or who can force the rythym in their favour. While the absence of Rodri contributed to the problem of City not being able to control the rythym of the game, it is not the only factor. Aging squad, tactical issues and injuries all played their roles. 

*Also not-so fun fact but this is first time since 2004-5 season that we have lost 2 out of the 3 opening games.

​Defensive and Pressing Problems: Our pressing is simply not effective enough. You might have noticed that for some time that out wingers are pressing form the inside, allowing the fullbacks or other players the eintiriy of the flank open. Examples from matches against Brighton , Real Madrid, and Spurs perfectly illustrate this issue.

Our fullbacks are always caught out of position, last season it was the left side with Gvardiol always way up the field our opponents target the space in behind the left side the same goes for the right side. And the resulting counters goes straight to goal because only some of our centerbacks seem to have pace and whole of our midfield had no legs. 
This season also we have the same problems at the back, its either rico lewis out of position somewhere in the midfield or nunes high and wide, or Ait nouri somewhere wide forward. The opponents just have to wait patiently till those wide spaces open up and ping the ball there for their forwards to run into.",43,0,2025-09-14T04:45:41,https://reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/1nghtc2/problems_that_need_to_be_addressed_asap/ne46ppo/,2025-09-20T11:53:25.248848

neadz6z,comment,real madrid,MCFC,MarkedlyMark,,"Fundamentally we need to relearn how to be a formidable team. 

Even at our best last season we had complacently lapsed into a style of play where it seemed possession was simply enough to win a game. It felt like we were only waiting for the opposition to either tire or to make a mistake. Whenever we went behind there was nothing there - no attacking threat. Nothing. 

We're improving again, but slowly and spasmodically.  When we found ourselves behind against Spurs and Brighton, we had little to offer. 

I think the key to our revival might actually be Reijnders. He showed against Wolves what he's capable of. But the next two matches - well he was barely there. Even yesterday, there were a couple of instances where he looked like he was playing in concrete boots.

During that match, Real Madrid didn't have the ball nor any opportunity, except one shot which wasn't on target from Kroos or Modrid, I don't remember. I've never seen such a dominance on the pitch during a match from PSG at this level, but we were high class. Very high class. Very high level.


Just watch this match again. The middlefield was literally ours. We could everything we wanted. 
Damn fucking Messi and his missed penalty.


The 2nd leg, we were better overall. Real Madrid was a bit more dangerous as they were playing at home, which is normal. However, we were in total control. Until this litigious action against Donnarumma. 


Even today, I can't understand how we lost it in 30 minutes. It’s even more complicated to understand how we lost it against Madrid than the whole shit against barcelona. Nah man, I just can’t get it. That’s beyond me.


I mean there are some explanations, for sure, but still... 


But my analysis of 21-22 was that the club improved crescendo and the peak was against Real Madrid (which won the Champions League afterwards).

1nlsb2y,post,barcelona,soccer,Moug-10,"Criminals on the run and Kremlin support: 1XBet, controversial betting partner","*This week, PSG officially announced the extension of its partnership with 1xBet for three more seasons. A brand unknown to the general public, yet one that hides illegal activities. Our journalist Philippe Auclair outlines the multiple offences and criminal activities attributed to the company, which has close ties to the Kremlin. Yet its place in football is growing.*

  
""1XBet is the Wagner Group of gambling. A company said to be close to the Kremlin, founded by former FSB members, which is not afraid to operate illegally, encourage corruption and aggressively target the African market.""

The person who said this is not just anyone. It is Corentin Ségalen of the ANJ, coordinator of the French platform for combating manipulation of sports competitions and president of the Copenhagen Group, one of the most influential voices in Europe when it comes to the opaque world of illegal betting sites.

Let's not beat around the bush: 1XBet is illegal. This includes France, despite the Russian-Cypriot bookmaker's constant efforts to circumvent the regulations in place in our country, where it is prohibited. This did not prevent Paris Saint-Germain from extending its partnership contract with 1XBet until 2028 a few days ago, and from publishing a press release whose content will make all those who are fighting against the growing influence of this online betting giant choke.

""Over the coming seasons, 1xBet will retain its status as Official Partner of Paris and its logo will be displayed on LED boards and 3D carpets visible internationally. This partnership also includes the creation of joint content for Paris Saint-Germain's social media and other digital platforms. In addition, 1xBet will regularly call on legendary players from the French club for its activities, offering unique experiences to supporters and partners.""

You may have noticed the phrase ""visible internationally"". Those watching the European champions' matches in France will have no idea that they have chosen to partner with one of the most controversial players in an industry where competition is fierce. The situation will be quite different in Rabat, Dakar, Mumbai or Mexico City, thanks to technology.

First, a little history. It's worth telling. In the early 2010s, in Bryansk, Russia, not far from the Ukrainian border, three men named Roman Semiokhin, Dimitri Kazorin and Sergei Karshkov set up their ""Bookmakers Pub"", a modest operation that within a few years would become the headquarters of a lucrative online betting business, despite not having applied for (or obtained) a licence from the Russian Federal Tax Service, as required by law. Semiokhine and Kazorine were ""businessmen"", while Karshkov was a senior Russian intelligence officer (he rose to the rank of major before fleeing to Cyprus) and the regional head of the Russian Interior Ministry's anti-cybercrime service.

The success of ""Bookmakers Pub"", which became 1XBet, did not escape the attention of the authorities, who discovered that the trio had amassed revenues of around half a billion euros – undeclared to the tax authorities – between 2014 and 2019. But Semiokhin, Kazorin and Karshkov were already far away, in Cyprus, where they had obtained citizenship by purchasing a ""golden passport"".

This forced exile marked the true birth of 1XBet, which until then had been mainly active in Russia and Eastern European countries, but whose hyper-aggressive expansion policy would make it a global leader, with a turnover that is unknown but easily exceeds £10 billion, according to the most conservative estimates. 1XBet had made Africa its number one target and achieved its goal by using regional subsidiaries entrusted to African subcontractors, who then pay their dues to the parent company – which pays no tax on its profits.

The recipe? First and foremost, total disregard for local regulations, to the point that 1XBet was, until recently, the shirt sponsor of Raja Casablanca, even though the operator is not only illegal in Morocco but is also the subject of a criminal complaint filed by the authorities. 1XBet is also facing prosecution in India and is blacklisted in all European countries except two, Spain and Ireland.

Furthermore, 1XBet offers much more generous odds than those offered by legal operators, who pay their taxes (which explains this), but this does not mean that 1XBet's luckier customers always receive what they are owed.

Finally, the recruitment of an army of ambassadors and influencers, most of whom receive a percentage of the losses incurred by bettors who use their ""bonus codes"". Among them are Russian porn star Eva Elfie and Cameroonian football legend and current Fécafoot president Samuel Eto'o, despite the statutes of the African Football Confederation (CAF) and FIFA, which prohibit this type of partnership. It is true that CAF has also made 1XBet an official sponsor of its most prestigious competitions, the next of which will be played in Morocco. This is likely to cause a significant headache for the organisers.

And let's not forget the clubs that pocket millions of euros for being the operator's ""official partner"". In France, OL and LOSC were partners before changing their minds. PSG, however, persisted and signed. We don't know exactly how much this brings in for the Parisians, but given the expansion of joint promotional activities, PSG's status as European champions and the rates charged in this area, €15 million per season seems like a minimum. Illegal operators such as 1XBet pay more than their licensed competitors. A kind of reward for crime, if you know what I mean.

Barcelona is another such partner, but Barcelona at least has the excuse that the 1XBet brand has acquired a licence in Spain via a tiny branch in Valencia.

This, when 1XBet is subject to sanctions imposed by President Zelensky himself, as an entity close to the Kremlin. The fugitives and Putin's regime quickly made up. The operator smoothed things over by becoming a sponsor of the club closest to the FSB, FC Dynamo Moscow, in 2020, and still operates in Russia through its subsidiary Melbet. 1XBet also pledged to donate 1% of bets placed on its other subsidiary, 1XStavka, to the ‘Russian heroes of the special military operation’ in Ukraine.

As revealed by a joint investigation by Bellingcat and Josimar, 1XBet also organises more than 500,000 (yes, you read that right) rigged ‘fake games’ (\*) of four, six or eight-a-side indoor football, played 24 hours a day in Russian clubs, in order to feed the range of matches offered to their most addicted customers.

But for Richard Heaselgrave, PSG's new Chief Revenue Officer, 1XBet is not a bookmaker founded by fugitive criminals, an illegal operator, a vampire preying on African youth or a Kremlin supporter. No, 1XBet is ‘a global brand that shares our ambition for innovation and international growth’. 

Well, that’s reassuring.

Some interesting insights:

* Longest  distance: Kairat vs Sporting (6.902 KM)
* Shortest distance: Union Saint-GIlloise vs PSV (104 KM)
* Longest travel team: Kairat (or Madrid if excluding *outlier* teams)
* Shortest travel team: Atalanta 
* Longest guest travel team: Kairat (or Sporting then Arsenal, if excluding *outlier* teams)
* Shortest guest travel team: PSG
* Most advantaged (travel distance diff): Arsenal (6.999 KM less)
* The biggest disadvantage: Real Madrid (6.412 KM more)

You can check individual club travel or each match's details.

But here's my problem, I honestly feel like we have one of the worst fanbase. And I'm not talking about rival fans or haters, I'm talking about our own supporters

The way some of us go after our players, saying harsh things, dragging them down... I don't get it. Of course, we all want the team to perform well and win, but hating on our own players? That just makes zero sense to me.

Even if some of them aren't the best in the world, guys like Araújo, Fermín(he's hated in football twitter way too much), or Martin are giving everything they have for the badge. They deserve support, not hate.

Honestly, this toxic side of our fanbase feels worse than anything rival fans could ever say.

We have been tracking ticket releases on the official site for other games in the meantime and it looks like they are only releasing VIP ones for 1,000 plus per ticket a few days out. Understand that’s because these games are being held at much smaller stadiums. Does anyone know if the game on the 28th will be easier to get tickets for or have advice for how to get them? And if anybody has any more recent updates on where that game will be held with all the ongoing renovations/capacity issues, that would be great.

1niphnw,post,barcelona,Barca,noviedovie,Bars in Barcelona to watch game,"I’m sure a ton of us are in the same boat so wanted to ask the group. What are the best bars in Barcelona to watch the game? I am going to be in town for a few days and was planning on going to a game but with only VIP tickets for €950 being sold, I’m planning for alternatives. Are people buying secondary on stubhub or are we just straight out of luck?

Are there good Barca bars in the area where people go to have a few drinks and watch the game? Would love to hear your best options. I’ll be in town from this Friday through Tuesday so would love to hear everyone’s thoughts!

nf6jd9n,comment,barcelona,Barca,Ok_Lawfulness7412,,"Because of 2 bad matches . Both got us knocked out of UCL . 2024 PSG match and then 2025 inter 2nd leg . I think that inter match wasn't only his fault , we could have become more pragmatic or keep more possession instead of going for another attack but at the end it was him who let acerbi score the Equalizer. Also him not being a ball playing centre back is like cherry on top of all this situation. Tbh I personally still rate him highly and I still believe we shouldn't sell a player like him , he is very crucial . For us . People don't even appreciate his good games and just makes him a scapegoat for all defensive problems for some reason . Look at Newcastle match , we didn't play a extreme highline and were a little deeper than our usual position and araujo did perform. I think till the time we have a ball carrier like de Jong or a player like Bernal in the Midfield we can use araujo . If we have someone like gavi or casado in Midfield then Christensen should be used .",35,0,2025-09-20T02:26:40,https://reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/1nllvch/what_happened_to_arujo_at_barcalona_why_isnt_he/nf6jd9n/,2025-09-20T11:55:04.579130

Also, the majority of that discourse is actually bullshit and devoid of any genuine football takes (but it's visibility is high), because why would you go hellbent and start a discussion trying to prove some objectively false takes like ""CR7 isn't a UCL beast and is overrated"" or ""Messi cannot thrive without a good team"".",2,0,2025-09-19T18:35:06,https://reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/1nla2sf/do_we_have_the_most_selfdestructive_fanbase_in/nf47cep/,2025-09-20T11:55:07.011832

nf22yd5,comment,barcelona,Barca,xjordi,,"Hey mate I don’t think general public is on sale quite yet. If you check the official statement. 

Translated from Spanish:

The match of FC Barcelona against Paris Saint-Germain will be played at the Estadio Olímpic Lluís Companys with the same capacity for members as in the 2024/2025 season.

Purchase preference: the 16,151 members and members of the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys Subscription in the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons in Montjuïc, will enjoy a 24-hour purchase preference.

After the 24 hours of pre-sale for this group, the sale will be opened for the rest of the members who had a subscription at the Estadio Olímpic Lluís Companys at some point.

Soon, the Club will communicate the calendar and the specific dates on which the ticket sales process will begin, both for members and for the general public.

Match prices
The prices that will be applied for this match, for those members who have been holders of the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys Subscription in the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons, are proportional to the price of what would be the complete Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys Season Full. In this sense, ticket prices range between 11 and 37 euros, depending on the stadium area.

The Club reminds that tickets will be nominal and can only be purchased through official channels. Given the capacity of the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, it is recommended to carefully follow the deadlines established to guarantee attendance at the match.

net5zm0,comment,barcelona,Barca,Sick4Quality,,"By those dates, I expect the club will have already decided where they’ll be playing at least until January, since the first big match will be coming up soon against PSG, and it’s impossible for a Champions League game to be played at the Johan Cruyff.

If the match is at Montjuïc, you’ll easily be able to get tickets on the club’s website.

If it’s at Camp Nou, it’ll be a bit harder because of the limited capacity plus the number of members that will attend the game.

I recently saw an interview on a Spanish football show where they talked with a fan who bought tickets on StubHub and they turned out to be fake.

net3qsr,comment,barcelona,Barca,Sick4Quality,,"I’m in the same situation, I also really want to go to that match.

At the moment, for the games played at the Johan Cruyff Stadium, it’s impossible to buy basic tickets, since the club is giving them all to members who have attended every game in the last two years, as a way to reward their loyalty.

For the match on November 22, the possibilities are either playing at Camp Nou, with a capacity of around 20,000 spectators, or playing at Montjuïc.

If it’s at Montjuïc, I’m sure basic tickets will be easy to get once sales open a few days before the match.

If it’s at Camp Nou, it will depend a lot on how many tickets the club decides to give to the socios.

Unfortunately, there’s no way to give a more accurate answer; things are still a bit up in the air.

Doku looking mighty dangerous these days and Khus looking like he’s got RB on lock. Even when he got rinsed before Napoli went a man down he still recovered to deny an entry pass. Reijnders still not fully integrated but getting better. He’s a very clever player, think him and Cherki are going to have some beautiful linkups at some point.

Edit: Just feel like Gvardiol is kind of wasted as a CB.

1njnrp6,post,manchester city,MCFC,zubairatif075,[The Athletic] Battling Erling Haaland relishes new leadership role at Manchester City,"""Haaland is winning possession back 1.9 times per game this season, compared to previous averages with City of 1.1 (2024-25), 1.7 and 1.2. He is winning 68.2 per cent of his duels compared to previous averages of 42.9% last term, 47.8% and 40.6%. He has yet to lose a single aerial duel across the 10 he’s contested in the four matches.""

""Haaland joined in the summer of 2022 but only six players pre-date his arrival. After the exodus of experience, there are 10 players younger than him and 14 older than him. It puts him in a sweet spot in the group and is why he has become an important conduit between Guardiola and the players, communicating and passing information back and forth.

There are daily leadership group meetings and he has sought to find his own leadership style, showing others how to live an elite lifestyle while also communicating to the squad what levels are required. Although it was this summer that Haaland ‘s captaincy role was confirmed, Guardiola is understood to have chosen him as Walker’s replacement in the leadership group in January, which coincided with a much stronger finish to the season""",109,7,2025-09-17T20:06:26,https://reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/1njnrp6/the_athletic_battling_erling_haaland_relishes_new/,2025-09-20T11:57:29.873711

You can see the difference between his shirt and the one James Trafford wore against Brighton, as well as the fit, the replica version has a stitched crest and PUMA logo rather than them being heat applied.

1nihirc,post,manchester city,MCFC,LADbible,"It's caused a lot of debate, but who was really in the wrong? 😬","A photo of the barman was shared on social media, clearing showing him waring the opposition’s shirt 😬

In response to the tweet, the official City account responded: “Thank you for making us aware of this.

""We can confirm that this individual has now been removed from their position.”

Some people have slammed City’s reaction to the incident, with one person writing on Twitter: ""Pathetic from City.""

Others had differing opinions, however, with another adding: ""He won't have worked directly for the club. Chances are it a third party that he works for but even if it wasn't the club can remove him from duties for safety reasons he deliberately wore that to get a reaction and especially on derby day it could of been worse.""



What do yo make of the situation? Did they do the right thing? 🤔

Also Shearer would kill to have one season with KDB, Rodri, Gundo, Bernado Silva, Foden etc around him. He’s level of service was rubbish with that Newcastle team.

1nga8fn,post,manchester city,LiverpoolFC,danielbsig,Max number of Liverpool players on the pitch at the same time,"In light of how many ex Liverpool players are now playing at Brentford, it is interesting to figure out which game in Premier League history has had the most number of Liverpool players on the pitch, i.e. obviously 11 players playing for Liverpool, but then the opponent might have had either ex Liverpool players on the pitch, or players that would later play for Liverpool. Maybe we would like to focus solely on ex Liverpool players (and skip those that would later go on to play for Liverpool), but I won't do that here.

In short, the game with the most Liverpool players on the pitch at the same time would be Liverpool - Southampton in fall of 2013. Southampton fielded 4 players that would all go on to play for Liverpool: Adam Lallana, Nathaniel Clyne, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert.

The next games which are close would be Liverpool vs Chelsea in spring 2013. Fernando Torres was actually the only ex-Liverpool player that started for Chelsea, but Victor Moses and Yossi Benayoun were later substituted. Also, Rafa Benitez was managing Chelsea at that time, so we could say they had 3.5 Liverpool individuals (players/managers). The era between 2009 to 2014 saw a lot of players play for Chelsea that either had previously played for Liverpool or would later do so: Nicolas Anelka, Fabio Borini, Yossi Benayoun, Daniel Sturridge, Fernando Torres, Raul Meireles, Victor Moses, and a relatively unknown player called Mo Salah. They had at most 5 Liverpool players in their squad at any given season, but never more than 3 of those on the pitch at the same time.

Another team which had a lot of Liverpool players was Stoke from 2012 - 2017. Among the Liverpool players they had in their ranks were: Peter Crouch, Jermaine Pennant, Charlie Adam, Michael Owen, Oussama Assaidi, Victor Moses, Glen Johnson, Joe Allen and Xherdan Shaqiri. However, for some reason the most number of Liverpool players on the pitch at the same time for Stoke was in a 0-0 game in spring 2018 where Allen, Shaqiri and Crouch were all playing at the same time.

We also have Manchester City in 2003-2004, when they had David James, Robbie Fowler, Nicolas Anelka, and Steve McManaman. Also, Kevin Keegan was manager. Both games between these teams only featured 3 of those 4 plus Keegan as a manager, so again 3.5.

Finally, Aston Villa between 2008 and 2009 deserves a mention as well, with the game in spring in 2009 featuring Emile Heskey, James Milner, and Brad Friedel all starting the game.

Time will tell how many Liverpool players the Liverpool - Brentford games this season will feature, i.e. we don't know how many of Kelleher, SvdB, Hendo and Carvalho will be involved, but we also can't rule out the possibility that a current Brentford player might get signed by Liverpool later.

**Match Facts**

* Manchester United are unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League home games against Chelsea (W5 D7) since a 0-1 defeat in May 2013. Indeed, Chelsea’s win rate of 18% at Old Trafford in the Premier League (6/33) is their lowest away to any side they have visited 10 times or more in the competition.
* After their 1-0 win in May, Chelsea are looking for successive league victories over Manchester United for the first time since winning three in a row from November 2009 to March 2011 under Carlo Ancelotti. The Blues’ two wins in their last three league games versus the Red Devils (D1) are as many as their previous 17 beforehand (W2 D9 L6).
* Chelsea vs Manchester United is the most drawn fixture in Premier League history, finishing level 27 times. Fourteen of those draws have taken place at Old Trafford, with the Everton vs. Spurs fixture at Goodison Park being the only one at a specific venue to be drawn more often in the competition (17 times).
* Manchester United have won two of their last three home Premier League matches (L1), as many as in their previous 11 at Old Trafford combined (W2 D2 L7). They are looking for consecutive home league victories within the same season and under the same manager for the first time since December 2023 under Erik ten Hag.
* Only Manchester City (8.5) has a higher expected goals total than Manchester United (8.3) so far in the Premier League this season. However, only Burnley (9.4), Aston Villa (7.4), and Wolves (7.2) have a higher xG against than the Red Devils (6.9).
* Despite scoring only five times, Manchester United have had 94 shots in their last four home Premier League games, attempting at least 20 in every game. They last had 20+ shots in more consecutive league games at Old Trafford between March and September 2012 under Sir Alex Ferguson (8 in a row).
* Bryan Mbeumo has been involved in six goals in seven Premier League appearances against Chelsea (3 goals, 3 assists) – all while playing for Brentford – but all of these goal involvements came at Stamford Bridge. It is the joint-most goals and assists against a single opponent with none coming on home soil by any player in Premier League history.
* No player has been involved in more Premier League goals this season than Chelsea’s João Pedro (5 – 2 goals, 3 assists). The Brazilian has also scored three goals in his five games against Man Utd in the competition – against no side has he scored more.

1nl555c,post,manchester city,Gunners,ahjkolhs,"[Arsenal] Arteta gives update on Saka, Saliba and Ødegaard.","Mikel Arteta will assess whether Bukayo Saka, Ben White and Martin Odegaard will be fit enough to feature against Manchester City on Sunday following our final training session 24 hours earlier.

Bukayo has been out of action since coming off against Leeds United four weeks ago, while Ben and Martin were also not part of the squad who beat Athletic Club on Tuesday after picking up injuries since then.

Mikel is hopeful that some of those could be back in time for our clash with City at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, but needs more time to assess his options.

Reflecting on whether the trio could feature, he said: “If there is a chance, it will be after tomorrow's session because they haven't done anything yet, so we'll have more information tomorrow.

""Everything has been modified so far for them. There are still a few things to clear and tomorrow we'll have more information on whether they are part of the squad or if they have a chance to be part of the squad.""

Mikel also confirmed that Viktor Gyokeres and Mikel Merino are fine to feature after being on the receiving end of head injuries in Bilbao, while he admits he has a selection headache of his own now William Saliba is back available again.

The Frenchman was back on the bench on Tuesday, with Cristhian Mosquera once again deputising in his place, and his impressive displays have encouraged the boss and given him plenty of food for thought.

On whether William will return again City, Mikel added: “Let's see, obviously he's been carrying an injury, he's done really well to be available for the last match and he’s really pushing it, so we will decide tomorrow who is the best to start.

“[Mosquera] is very good. I think credit to the scouting department and Andrea [Berta] that they presented the opportunity to have him. Again, as a boy, he’s extremely focused, very determined, very clear that he wanted to come here and he wanted to come here to play and earn his place. I think what he's doing in that position, so early, is very impressive.”",412,88,2025-09-19T14:30:40,https://reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1nl555c/arsenal_arteta_gives_update_on_saka_saliba_and/,2025-09-20T11:58:06.984246

nf1i5vb,comment,liverpool,soccer,NewLoad886,,"The Football Association is investigating Liverpool goalkeeper Rafaela Borggräfe over an allegation she used discriminatory language of a racial nature.  

Borggräfe, who joined Liverpool in July, is alleged to have used an inappropriate phrase during the club’s pre-season camp in Cork – a week before the start of the Women’s Super League campaign.  

An FA spokesperson told Telegraph Sport they were aware of the matter and are looking into it.  

Borggräfe missed the club’s first game of the season, the Merseyside derby on September 7, with manager Gareth Taylor explaining that her absence was down to an “internal matter”.  

The FA’s investigation is ongoing and, as per official guidelines, Borggräfe was permitted to return to training and she was on the bench for the club’s 1-0 defeat by Leicester last weekend.",113,0,2025-09-19T09:25:18,https://reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1nkyuks/liverpool_womens_goalkeeper_investigated_for/nf1i5vb/,2025-09-20T11:58:35.271310

1nlpcfg,post,liverpool,ChampionsLeague,iwannasleepp,Do you agree or not with this statement that Ancelotti has underachieved everywhere he goes?,"He inherited pretty much the best squad in the world at Juventus, won nothing of note. Got sacked. At Milan he had an even better squad and he only won a single Serie a, 2 CLs and a single Coppa Italia in 8 years. First half of his stint was successful but still underwhelming compared to how utterly good that team was, there were also two historical chokes against Liverpool and Deportivo. Second half of the stint was much more disappointing, saved only by a CL win in 07. Words cannot express how disappointing his final seasons were. Didn't get sacked.

Great first year at Chelsea, 2nd one was fairly disappointing. Got sacked. At PSG he hilariously managed to lose out a title after he had come mid season when PSG were in 1st place. Like with Chelsea, he wasn't able to achieve significant results in the CL. Didn't get sacked.

At Real, similar to Chelsea, great 1st season, underwhelming 2nd one. But also similar to Chelsea, he inherited a ready squad built up by one Jose Mourinho. Got sacked, though pretty harshly.

His stints at Bayern and Napoli were extremly disappointing. His Bayern were a massive fall off after Heynckes and Guardiola, got sacked very early on in his 2nd season. In Napoli, he also inherited a pretty good squad (notice a trend?) that was getting ~90 points a season under Sarri, came second but couldn't really compete for the title. A clear drop off. His second season he got sacked early again because of how bad Napoli performed. Gattuso did better that same season.
At Everton he started off fairly ok and finished disappointing.

2nd stint at Real was obviously pretty great with 2 CLs won, though they were pretty much outplayed at every knockout matchup in both of their winning runs. Unimpressive play Real had in this stint was a cloud that constantly gloomed over Ancelotti and in the end was the reason why he didn't stay longer.

He obviously won a lot, but when put in context, surely you can see why he was pretty underwhelming in most of his jobs.

As for better Italian coaches, off the top of my head, Trapattoni, Sacchi, Lippi, Capello, Nereo Rocco. That's 5 extremely successful ones. There are countless more who were better but didn't get the opportunities Ancelotti did.",0,22,2025-09-20T05:01:52,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nlpcfg/do_you_agree_or_not_with_this_statement_that/,2025-09-20T11:59:28.163613

1nitux8,post,liverpool,realmadrid,Short_Mousse_6812,What do you expect for Madrid?,"  After the match today against Marseille it is obvious, there is still something lacking, a more clinical finishing. The team was over the place and we depended on luck, if we are honest, to barely win. It seems that our whole game plan relies on Mbappe. Mastantuono showed to be promising but still lacks development, same as Guler who is amazing, but had a bad game. Our attack is not necessarily bad, but besides Mbappe the team missed way too many chances today. What do you expect to happen from here on? Since for now it seems like Liverpool will give us a big defeat. ",19,88,2025-09-16T21:08:26,https://reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1nitux8/what_do_you_expect_for_madrid/,2025-09-20T11:59:45.669227

I have followed the club since EA Sports' Fifa 2011, back when our main striker was Carlos Tevez but we had just signed Agüero. I read that Napoli is playing us in the League Phase on September 18, then I remembered that club legend KDB recently joined Napoli. How will he be received at the Etihad? Will he get a standing ovation, or will he be booed and jeered? I hope the former. I remember when Raheem Sterling played for us and when we would play Liverpool at Anfield he always got rough treatment. I hope the City fans do not do KDB like that. His brilliant passing was a key part of our success in the past decade, and he has been a good guy who has always represented the club well. 

Edit: Conte subs KDB off after a Napoli red card, so his homecoming only lasted 26 mins; still good to see the crowd give him a standing ovation and do the Seven Nation Army ""Oh Kevin De Bruyne"" chant.",3,23,2025-09-15T00:11:24,https://reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/1nh76s7/how_does_everyone_feel_about_kdb_returning_to/,2025-09-20T11:59:52.529967

""For me, when you are a great player you still contribute to the team if you don’t play well. So, so many players can contribute goals and assists when they play well but not a lot of them can contribute something to the team when they don’t play well and by this I mean goals and assists. 

So, they can always give their work-rate *but this is what stands out with Mo. I think, and this is normal, especially when you are a winger, it is so difficult to always be creative, always be the player he was against Atletico Madrid, but if he is not that player – which is normal – then he still has goals and assists and I think that is why the fans love him so much and why he is so highly regarded and respected*.""

...""Because a lot, a lot, a lot of players can play good when the team plays good or when they play good themselves, but *not a lot can do special things when they are not at their best and that’s what he can and what makes him so special,* I think. 

But I prefer to see him like he was in the Atletico game. He was very much involved, that was also very positive. So, in the Newcastle game there was hardly ball in play so it was difficult for every player to be special, but now we played so many balls to him, he was so much involved, touched the ball so many times, Florian found him so many times. 

So that was a joy to watch to see him like that, but if we don’t see him like that he is still able to score goals and that’s what makes him special.""

=====

* **On whether he would consider playing Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike as a front two…**

I consider, of course, because you consider many things and it depends always on how well they are doing, so if both of them are in the best form of their life you would even consider it more, playing them together. But it’s also clear that we have a certain structure, which has mainly been 4-3-3 \[and\] playing with three midfielders, but the amount of times we have, at the end phase of the game, played with two nines, that has happened quite a lot as well.

Hugo can indeed also play from the left differently from Cody \[Gakpo\] or Rio \[Ngumoha\] and that’s the good thing about our squad, we have multiple options. But first of all they all have to stay fit to have these options and if some of them are not fit then we might have to use them both in a 4-4-2. That all depends on the form of them and how many players we have available. All of them are fit now and I think I can maybe choose between 21 players, so that’s quite normal. It’s not that it’s far too much.

nf2cdeu,comment,liverpool,LiverpoolFC,klaygdk,,">There was a message waiting for Beto on the day he arrived at Everton.

>As the striker settled into new surroundings after a £25.8million move from Torino at the end of the summer transfer window in 2023, he came across a post that had been sent to his Instagram account.

>“I’m happy for you,” it read. “If you need anything in the city, I can help you. Just give me a shout.”

>That greeting was from Diogo Jota.

>Beto did not know Jota at that point. Even allowing for their shared Portuguese heritage, that it was the rival from Liverpool who reached out across the city’s divide to make him feel welcome serves as a mark of the man.

>“Of all the big names from Portugal that play in England, he was the first one to text me,” Beto says. “The day I signed or the next day. “You have Bernardo Silva, Bruno Fernandes and he was the first guy, the first person.

>“We were not friends but, you know, when you play against Portuguese players and everything, we normally stop, we speak a little bit.

>Jota reached out to Beto before the striker moved to EvertonEPA

>“After every game that we play against Liverpool, we talk a little bit. I ask, ‘How is everything?’ Not just because he was Portuguese, but he was a really, really nice person. Humble. And you can see what everyone says about him.

>“The day that thing happened, I was at home in Portugal. That day I would travel to Manchester to come here for the pre-season. And I was shocked. I was shocked because Diogo was a really good guy.”

Van Dijk is someone I can confidently say is the greatest ever center back I've seen in my lifetime. I lived through the 00s, so I've seen all the supposed greats - Cannavaro, Nesta, Terry, Ferdinand, Vidic etc - but no one even comes close to Virgil. All very good players, but Virgil is literally the Messi of center-backs, he changed the way I see the position entirely, never knew someone could be so good.

1nlewfm,post,liverpool,Gunners,chaairman,Defensive football? Or good defense?,"This has been a major point of contention over the last few weeks and I’m curious what you guys think.

I don’t feel like we play “defensive football.” I feel like we’re just (very) good defensively but people confuse that for playing “defensive football.”

For example regarding the Liverpool game, lots of people said Arsenal plays with 4 CBs and 3 DMs, which maybe is what those players have listed on the fbref as their position. But that’s not at all reflective of how we actually play is it?

I feel like people say that and it gives the idea that those 4 CBs are camped in the box with 3 DMs directly in front of them when surely that’s not the case except for very particular game states.

I’m curious what y’all think. Defensive football or are we really good defensively?

ne7b5zd,comment,liverpool,Gunners,Zhirrzh,,"Pool are jammy bastards.


United is the world's most expensive lower midtable team. Individually a lot of the players look very good, and the fact that they add up to less than the sum of their parts is surely on the manager, yet can United afford to keep sacking managers? In this case I suspect that they must. 


When Sesko was subbed I gasped because I had forgotten he was even on the pitch. That level of anonymity is special. United keep ruining young strikers daft enough to take their money. 


They should have kept Moyes and given him more support. His entire reign was cruelled by the lousy first transfer window which probably wasn't mostly his fault, and the inevitable post Fergie impatience, but since sacking him they seem to plumb greater depths every sack. 


City are absolutely still contenders. That was one of the best all round performances I've seen Haaland produce, he was very engaged even on defensive headers in his own box, created that golden opportunity Reijnders managed to miss, and again I think Arteta is hoping that Gyok will basically be our Haaland. ",32,0,2025-09-14T17:40:30,https://reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1ngqouu/rival_watch_thread/ne7b5zd/,2025-09-20T12:01:03.205241

I have been watching football since 2009. At that point the major new formation was a 4-2-3-1 with attacking fullbacks a creative 10 and 2 cdms. This is not a blanket description for all teams but rather what was META. Today teams are trying to keep a back 5 in possession with a myriad of variations. 3+2 or 2+3 and an attacking 5. Imo it has become a bit stale watchibg football now..Luis Enrique's Psg are a breath of fresh air, So are Flicks Barca and Kompany's Bayern. They may use similar principles to Top EPL teams but they have the abiliry to attack with more freedom or seem to create more via individual quality. Bayerns 2-4-4 is a nice difference. PSG although they keep a 3+1 are so fluid and use so many variations to create more opportunities fo create and score

At the moment i feel like there is no dominant way to consistently Win games and play well",0,0,2025-09-17T10:12:34,https://reddit.com/r/football/comments/1nj952l/formations_tactics_today_2025/,2025-09-20T12:01:48.753109

1nilm97,post,psg,Barca,Crld02,How to buy tickets for a game?,"Hi guys, I’m travelling to Spain from Sep 18 to Oct 6. I will be landing in Madrid but I was hoping I could make a short trip to Barcelona because seeing a match in person is one of my dreams.

The problem is, I don’t seem to be able to buy a basic ticket. I turned on notifications to get alerted when tickets go on sale a few days before game-day, but the only option I have is premium VIP tickets, which are quite expensive (+750€).. I attached an example of the upcoming game vs Getafe.

Does anyone know if basic tickets ever become available? Are they all reserved for Barca partners and people that bought season tickets?

—————————
Something to mention is, I checked 5 minutes after I received the notification so the chances of tickets selling out in less than that for me are very low (?

Also, the game I was planning to go is vs. PSG on Oct 1st, is there any other way around it like buying from a reseller or something like that? I am travelling all the way from Canada, so this is kind of a one-opportunity-in-years situation and I would not like to miss it.

Thanks for the help!!",24,36,2025-09-16T16:04:12,https://reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/1nilm97/how_to_buy_tickets_for_a_game/,2025-09-20T12:02:14.048553
1ngh9y4,post,psg,Barca,WingAmazing3783,Is Culers premium worth it for access to Barca vs PSG October 1st game and Barca vs real Sociedad game? Do I need it for access to basic tickets access online?,"Hello I’m looking to go to Barca VS PSG game on October first however I am worried that the tickets will be very hard to get and I am worried the resale price will be too expensive.

I have already signed up for the emails that notify me of tickets sales however, is it worth to spend the 40€ for culers premium early ticket access. I would only be using the Premium access for Barca psg game and maybe real Sociedad game as I am from Canada and will not be in Spain for long.  

Also one other concern I have is whether or not I get access to basic tickets on the website without culers premium? I do not want to pay for VIP

nejaghz,comment,chelsea,soccer,Wakanda-shit-is-that,,"Vincent Kompany on whether he expects Cole Palmer to start tomorrow: ""Cole is an outstanding player. It wouldn't surprise me if he starts tomorrow, but they have another game against Manchester United on Saturday so I would also understand if they don't take the risk with him. But I know Cole very well and know he doesn't need a lot of time to have an impact""


Kompany on Uli Hoeneß' statement that Bayern are underdogs: ""Let's see what happens. Everyone's 100% up for the Champions League. We want to win the Champions League. There's no Bayern player or coach who would say otherwise. And then there's the reality. Others want that too. We're playing against the best teams in Europe. The only task now is Chelsea, but the dream remains nevertheless""


Kompany on what needs to happen to advance further than last season: ""You have to get through the knockout phase first, then anything's possible. We had nine injured players in the last game against Inter and still performed well. With PSG, for example, everyone was fit in the knockout phase. We didn't have that luxury. Obviously we hope for a fit squad so that we always have the best players available""


Kompany on the CL format: ""If we win six games, we'll be in the top eight. Four wins are enough for the play-offs. This phase is very interesting. There's a lot of drama in the new format, I think the fans like it. What's still difficult is that every team has different opponents. Our path is tough with Chelsea, Arsenal and PSG, but we want to get into the top eight""


Kompany on whether Nicolas Jackson is ready to start against his parent club: ""We'll see tomorrow. I won't reveal too much about the team. You can always look at it from two sides. Of course you're particularly motivated against your ex-club, but it will certainly be a special game for him""


Kompany on Serge Gnabry's form: ""Serge has always been a top player. It's not easy to deliver top performances for six or seven years. Maybe he's had a few hiccups. But he has great quality; I believe in him and his strengths. I hope he stays fit and maintains his level. He often performs against English teams, and he'll show that against other teams as well""

Kompany on whether he would ask Nicolas Jackson about Chelsea: ""Technically you could, but I've already watched probably 40 games of Chelsea last season. They're an interesting team to obverse. But I don't think there's a lot of mystery around them, and I know the coach very well. I'll quickly see tomorrow whether we've done our homework. But the most important thing is that the players feel good, not that I feel good. That applies to Enzo Maresca's team, too, of course.""

Kompany on last season's injuries in the decisive phase: ""Dayot Upamecano, Manuel Neuer, Alphonso Davies or Jamal Musiala have been injured in big games, that's part of it. You also just need luck sometimes. It was looking good for a long while last season, then a lot of things changed during the international break. That affects a season. The belief is there that we'll be lucky this year and they'll be fit when they're needed. We have a lot of players who have had injuries in the past, so we need to be extremely careful.""


We have the feeling the Bundesliga is not being taken seriously in England, where they call it 'farmers league'. You know both leagues well. How do you see the level of the Bundesliga?

Kompany: ""But how many players did they buy from the Bundesliga? How much money did they spend on Bundesliga players? I'm from Belgium, a small country. In Belgium, people always look to other bigger countries and we respect every league. In Germany, people pay a lot of attention to the Bundesliga; in England, they pay a lot of attention to the Premier League. Obviously there's a big financial gap between the Premier League and other leagues. We have to think about how we solve that one day. The Bundesliga certainly has a lot of talent, English teams have bought a lot of players from here. But tomorrow isn't about Bundesliga against Premier League. It's Bayern against Chelsea""",31,0,2025-09-16T15:00:34,https://reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1nijucb/kompany_on_whether_he_would_ask_nicolas_jackson/nejaghz/,2025-09-20T12:05:05.059810

Those protests are solely the acts of one group : The Ultra Boys 90, they are the most vocal and organized group in the stadium, but they account for a really small minority of it (some hundreds). Even inside the ""Kop"", which is about 4000 people, their views are not shared. 


Yesterday, something broke, they got booed by most of the stadium when releasing messages about Emegha and the president Mark Keller. The players usually celebrate the wins in front of the Kop did not go either. They are ""fighting"" not only against the owner BlueCo, but basically everyone at this point.

new6x8c,comment,chelsea,ChampionsLeague,AllAboutMaxx,,"Vicente del Bosque and Marcello Lippi are the only managers in history to win both the champions league and the World Cup. For me this puts them over Mourinho. 

Ernst Happel won the Champions League/European Cup with Feynoord and Hamburg, also World Cup finalists with the Netherlands. He also brought Club Brugge to the final of the European cup. He’s above Mourinho for me.

Jupp Heynckes won 2 Champions Leagues. The team he created at Bayern Munich broke all domestic records in Germany and dominates the Champions League. 

Ottmar Hitzfeld won the Champions League with Bayern and with Borussia Dortmund. With BVB beating juventus in the final in what was one of the competitions biggest upsets.

Arigo Sacchi changed Italian football. 3 European Cup finals in 5 seasons winning 2. Also took Italian national team to the World Cup final in 1994, unfortunately lost on pens. 

Trappatoni - 6x Seria A titles during the greatest period of Italian football ever. European Cup winner, x2 UEFA Cup winner, x2 Coppa Italia winner, Cup Winners Cup winner, then he goes to Inter Milan and wins the Seria A again plus the UEFA Cup. 22 major titles.

Michels paved the foundation for Ajax to win 3 European Cups on a row. Then took the Netherlands to the World Cup final playing a style of football nobody had ever seen before, reinventing the game. Cruyff then took these core principles and expanded them while at Barcelona and won 4 league titles in a row, and won Barcelona its first European Cup. He also created and completely revolutionised La Masia which has had a lasting impact on Barcelona. Prior to Cruyff joining Barcelona had won 29 major trophies. Since Cruyff took over Barcelona in 1988 Barca has won 60 major trophies in 37 years. 

Then you have Pep and Ferguson who for me sit at their own table.",12,0,2025-09-18T14:31:17,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nk674s/is_mourinho_one_of_the_greatest_managers_of_all/new6x8c/,2025-09-20T12:05:30.209343

1nk0r2e,post,chelsea,LiverpoolFC,ZoziBG,Just some interesting numbers on how our team did in the last 5 games.,"According to this [source](https://playerstats.football/premier-league/stats/goalkeeper-saves), in our last 5 games, we averaged about;

# 63% in possession. 

The highest was against Burnley with 81% and the lowest was when we played Arsenal, where we held 53%. Against Atleti, we had 56% of the ball. Here's how the top 7 teams in the PL are doing in comparison (Based on 5 games in);

1. LFC 63%
2. Arsenal 54%
3. Spurs 58%
4. Bournemouth 51%
5. Chelsea 59%
6. Everton 45%
7. City 63%

In the PL - We rank 7th with 35 in dispossession so far, sharing the spot with the likes of Forest and Everton. City and Villa are top of the league in getting dispossessed with 47 each, followed by Chelsea at 40 and United at 38. Hugo is the player who gets dispossessed the most in our team, with 7 so far. Mo and Flo each got dispossessed 5 times, and Cody 4 times. Everton's Grealish and Ndiaye have been dispossessed 19 times between them so far this season. 

# Goals 

In 5 games, we averaged 2.4 goals per game, conceding 1.2 goals. We scored a total of 12 goals so far, giving away 6.  Against other PL teams, LFC ranked first, sharing the top spot with Arsenal and Chelsea with 9 goals scored. City and Spurs are not far behind with 8 goals.  

xG (expected goals) - We're at 2.04 to 0.36 against us.  Against other PL teams, LFC ranked 5th in Player XG. The top spot is held by United at 9.33xG, followed by Chelsea, Arsenal, City, and then us.   
  
xGOT (expected goals on target) - at 1.59 against 1.09. In the Atleti match, their team had 2.07 against our 1.33. Burnley had 0.00 against our 1.12.   
  
Shots - We made 16 shots and only allowed 8 shots in return. We are on target 5.40 times per match, and of our 16 shots, 5.2 were made outside the box compared to 10.80 inside.  Against other PL teams, LFC is ranked 2nd in total shots taken with 60 registered, sharing the spot with Chelsea. United is first with 70 (lol). In terms of Shots on Target, we are also 2nd with 21 good shots. Chelsea is first with 22. Both LFC and Chelsea have 1/3 good shots out of all taken so far, and United managed 18 good ones out of their 70 shots taken.    
  
We've also scored first in 4 of our 5 matches so far. The stats somehow didn't recognise our Burnley penalty goal as scoring first. But take that into account, and we've scored first 5 times out of 5. 

# Passes  

We average about 532.80 passes. The highest we made so far was during that Burnley game with 697 passes. Against Atleti, we made 597, the second highest in our past 5 games.  

Against other PL teams, LFC ranked 3rd in total number of passes with 2067 passes made in 4 PL games. City is second with 2083, and Chelsea is first with 2209. On the player-level, our Captain, Virgil Van Dijk, currently leads the PL in total number of passes with 322.  We also ranked 3rd in the number of accurate passes with 1749. Chelsea is at 1960, and City is at 1811. On an individual level, Van Dijk is ranked first with 284 good passes.  

# Tackles  

We made 12.6 tackles per game but were tackled back 15.8 times on average. Bournemouth tackled us 20 times in that one game.   
  
Interceptions - We made the second least amount of interceptions in the league so far, with 18. Only the Spurs are behind us with 16. At the top of the chart is Chelsea with 46 interceptions. Caicedo leads the player's chart with 12 interceptions, followed by Burnley's Hartman with 10.  The players in the lowest bracket in the chart registered 4 interceptions. There are no Liverpool players in the whole chart. We don't get to intercept much, do we?",44,14,2025-09-18T06:21:19,https://reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1nk0r2e/just_some_interesting_numbers_on_how_our_team_did/,2025-09-20T12:05:56.664231

neufapj,comment,chelsea,LiverpoolFC,Nadirin,,"While this is correct, there is a difference when you look at the types of goals we've conceded. If we won 3-2 every game but are conceding lots of chances and high xG shots, that is bad and we're getting lucky. In reality, the only game we had a shaky defence was Bournemouth, and that was without Grav. Otherwise the goals we've conceded have been low xG attempts and in general the scorelines have not reflected the games. 


So yes, only goals matter at the end of the day, the data can tell you whether we're getting a bit lucky / unlucky and whether we're likely or not to keep conceding the same amount of goals. Pundits and other fans just see the scorelines so say we have a shaky defence, but looking at the data that just isn't true, so I expect it to average out soon. ",3,0,2025-09-18T06:41:02,https://reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1nk0r2e/just_some_interesting_numbers_on_how_our_team_did/neufapj/,2025-09-20T12:05:56.978375

Et autant passer dans 4-4-2 à un 4-3-3, ça se fait assez naturellement, autant le 3-5-2 est un système qui demande de nombreux matchs avant de le maîtriser parfaitement.

ne2ug5t,comment,chelsea,psg,Bullshakur,,"Our leaders have worked very well in sports policy from the moment our owners became aware that in football, there is an organization chart with a president, a sports director who works in tandem with the coach, and a great coach who advocates a style of play and who will validate or not the players suggested to him by the sports director depending on what he wants to build his team coherently. 
The departure of Mbappe notably caused an electric shock within the club in the conception of building a team on a collective and not on a lot of individuals as was the case with Neymar, Messi, Mbappe etc. 

In summary, all levels of the club worked in the same direction and with the same vision and this is what structured the club down to the team and the consecration of all that is the success we were able to have this season. (Even if nothing guarantees a final victory)

For many years, our current owners have sought to develop the brand and the global influence of the club by attracting big stars, sometimes and even often to the detriment of a coherent sporting policy, but I imagine that it was a choice and an important step that we had to go through to promote the club, attract sponsors, etc. Another parameter, the stars of PSG also served as brand image for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and I think that the arrival of Messi is not unrelated to this…

In the end in the QSI project, there were several stages, successes, failures, but now the club is self-sufficient and generates a lot of income, the payroll has fallen enormously with the loss of the stars, the stars are made by the club, the squad is much more composed of young French talents, and now the players come to PSG having in mind that here we can win big trophies. Luis Enrique had a huge role in all of this and managed to spread this mindset of resilience and this culture of winning to all levels of the club.

nf1ata9,comment,arsenal,soccer,MegaMugabe21,,"One of those moves that it's tough to know how it will affect the club from the outside. Been around for our best period in recent history, but who knows how responsible he was for that. Josh Kroenke getting involved I'm not sure about, two ways to read that, I guess:

1. He's decided people aren't doing enough to achieve success so is getting more involved to push that forward.

2. The club has reached a much higher level than it ever has under the Kroenkes control, and now he wants to bask in that.

He was involved a lot around the time of Artetas appointment when we had our big burst of improvement and then seems to have stepped back a bit until this summer. That makes me cautiously optimistic his decision to step back into the arena is more to do with the first point, but we shall see.",23,0,2025-09-19T08:11:21,https://reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1nkxhe2/david_ornstein_davidornstein_on_threads_tim_lewis/nf1ata9/,2025-09-20T12:07:26.607826

1njmrgw,post,arsenal,ChampionsLeague,aboss101,Bayern fans set the standard – English fans are embarrassing,"
Bayern fans show what real elite support and standards look like. In Germany, the atmosphere is on another level – 90 minutes of noise, passion, and demand for trophies. That’s proper elite football culture.

Compare that with England, especially Arsenal. The support is tourist-level half the time. Fans gas up a quarter-final or semi-final like it’s some massive achievement, while German fans wouldn’t even clap that. They expect trophies because that’s what big clubs are about.

In Germany and other countries, the fans drive their team on with world-class support and elite standards. In England, especially at Arsenal, it’s all PR, “trust the process,” and vibes. No pressure, no ruthlessness, no atmosphere. That’s the difference – winners vs cheerleaders.",0,14,2025-09-17T19:27:33,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1njmrgw/bayern_fans_set_the_standard_english_fans_are/,2025-09-20T12:08:15.106402
1nj727i,post,arsenal,ChampionsLeague,ArsenalAxis,Arsenal show real depth in UCL opener- Martinelli & Trossard deliver when it mattered most,"

Honestly, that felt like the perfect start to our Champions League campaign. Winning 2-0 away at San Mamés, especially with seven players out, shows the mentality shift this Arsenal side has had under Arteta. What impressed me most wasn’t just the goals from Martinelli and Trossard, but the way the team controlled the game, stayed patient, and then punished Bilbao when it mattered. Martinelli scoring just 36 seconds after coming on is exactly the kind of impact you want from your bench, and Trossard is quietly becoming one of the most reliable players in the squad. For me, this performance says a lot about our depth and resilience- two things we’ve lacked in Europe before. If we can grind out results like this even when we’re not at full strength, there’s no reason we can’t push deep into the competition again. Nights like these make me believe this squad is genuinely ready to take the next step.",1,45,2025-09-17T07:58:51,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nj727i/arsenal_show_real_depth_in_ucl_opener_martinelli/,2025-09-20T12:08:15.899388

People call it “control” and “tactical discipline” — let’s be real, it’s pure haram ball. Sit deep, pass sideways, waste time, hit the deck every five minutes, and kill the game until everyone watching wants to switch off.

This is supposed to be elite European football, but Arsenal are out here turning the biggest competition in world football into a training session in boredom. Imagine hyping up this “process” for years, spending hundreds of millions, only to play like Stoke City in disguise.

Don’t let the fanbase spin it as some masterclass in “game management.” It’s not levels, it’s not dominance, it’s damage limitation football dressed up as philosophy. Big clubs go into the Champions League to win — Arsenal turn up with three holding mids praying not to get exposed.

1nhsmw8,post,arsenal,ChampionsLeague,aboss101,Max Dowman is already Arsenal’s best player — Lee Gunner’s been spot on about him,"Lee Gunner has been saying it for weeks: Max Dowman is levels clear of most of our senior players. And he’s right.

This kid is 16 and already showing more awareness, technical ability, and confidence than players we’ve been hyping for years. He doesn’t play scared, he doesn’t hide, and he actually wants responsibility on the pitch. That’s mentality you can’t coach.

Meanwhile, some of our “big names” go missing in every big game. They can’t keep the ball under pressure, can’t dictate play, and crumble when it matters. Dowman comes in and looks like the only one with a proper football brain.

Lee always says Arsenal fans overrate average players — but Dowman isn’t hype, he’s the real deal. If Arteta actually built around him instead of wasting time on passengers, we’d look like a team that belongs in the Champions League.

What do Arsenal fans think — and rival fans too? Is Dowman already our best player, or are people just blind to what’s in front of them?",0,28,2025-09-15T17:42:30,https://reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1nhsmw8/max_dowman_is_already_arsenals_best_player_lee/,2025-09-20T12:08:21.870266

1njg19r,post,arsenal,LiverpoolFC,lachlan2143,When I'm Liverpool - Arsenal (H) + Deadline Day + Burnley (A),"Yep, hi. I'm not dead. Instead, despite saying I had ""nothing to do anymore"" on the first video, I managed to land a job I genuinely was not expecting to get. Go figure.

Hopefully the near five minutes of WIL will make up for it. Also, if we get results against Atletico and Everton, expect those to also be merged together into one big video, as I doubt I'd be able to get the Atleti video out before the derby.

I cannot thank you legends enough for not only the patience on this video, but the love and support on the first two. If they both flopped, I would've just stopped making them after landing my new job. Your support will keep me going.

I also know I have a lot of unread DMs - apologies! I'm actually barely on Reddit, but I'll try and make sure I get around to answering every message you guys send me.

(And if you saw me upload this the first time without the video, no you didn't)

1nhykbs,post,arsenal,LiverpoolFC,greybeard911,All four of our late goals were scored/created by substitutes made by Slot,"- Chiesa scored the winner against Bournemouth in the 88' and was brought on for Wirtz in the 82nd when the score was 2-2
- Ngumoha scored the winner against Newcastle in 90+10 and was brought on for Gakpo at 90+6. This was despite us being under pressure due to set pieces in the last few minutes. 
- Szoboszlai scored the winner against Arsenal but it was Jones's movement and Virgil's pass to get him that brings the foul. Jones was brought on for Mac Allister in the 61st minute.
- A bit of a stretch but Salah's pen against Burnley comes because of Frimpong's cross getting blocked by Hannibal's hand. Frimpong came on for Konate in the 87th minute.

You can say we've not been at our best. But saying that we're lucky and keep getting away with wins while playing shit is disingenuous. Slot's made aggressive changes in each game because he and the team wanted the win. Newcastle and the Ngumoha change was the first big example of that. But it's something we saw a lot even last year. 

We're 4 for 4 not because we're simply lucky . It's because we've got a manager and players make sure that they can get the luck in our favor.",199,16,2025-09-15T21:21:08,https://reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1nhykbs/all_four_of_our_late_goals_were_scoredcreated_by/,2025-09-20T12:08:55.459691

📖 **Match facts:**

* United have failed to win any of their last four WSL meetings with the Gunners (D2 L2), since a 1-0 home win in April 2023, with that victory coming courtesy of an Alessia Russo goal.
* Arsenal have won two of their last three games against United (D1), as many as in their previous eight meetings with them in all competitions (W2 D2 L4). That run includes a huge 4-3 victory for Arsenal on the final day of last season at the Emirates, with those three points ensuring they finished second in the table, ahead of United.

**🔎Preview:** [Arseblog](https://arseblog.news/category/arsenal-women/)

🗣️ **Pre-Match chatter :**

Two of the early pacesetters in the Women's Super League go head-to-head on Sunday, with their perfect records on the line.

United sit top of the table heading into matchday two, and the Gunners are just behind them on goal difference.

Both sides have scored nine goals so far, with United only conceding once to Arsenal's two, setting up an intriguing clash.

Renee (🐐) Slegers, fresh from achieving 100 goals scored since she took over (3.4 goals per game, the best record of any manager in WSL history), will be delighted with the fight her side have shown in recent weeks, but she will be hoping for a more straightforward affair in Manchester. In both matches so far this season, we have gone 1-0 down, marking the first time in WSL history that we've have won back-to-back matches by coming from behind.

In fact, should the same happen again at Leigh Sports Village, the Gunners would become the first team in WSL history to be losing in 3 consecutive games before coming back to win all of them.

Some nerves may start to set in if we concede the first goal, though, as we have lost two of our last three away matches in the WSL (W1), as many defeats as in our previous 13 (W9 D2).

However, we have only faced 1.1 expected goals against (xGA) across the first two matchdays, also conceding just nine shots, with both of those totals the lowest in the league so far.

1nkxvhl,post,arsenal,Gunners,ahjkolhs,[Arsenal] announce leadership and board update.,"We are delighted to announce that our Managing Director, Richard Garlick will become our Chief Executive Officer with immediate effect.

Richard joined us in 2021 as Director of Football Operations and has been at the club’s helm for the last year in his role as Managing Director, leading the club’s Executive Team.

Along with this change comes evolution to our Board of Directors, led by Co-Chairs, Stan and Josh Kroenke.  After five years with Arsenal, Tim Lewis steps down from the Board and has left the club. Kroenke Sports & Entertainment’s (KSE) Kelly Blaha and Otto Maly will join our Board as Non-Executive Directors alongside long-time KSE advisor, Dave Steiner. They will bring the KSE family closer together and offer a wide range of expertise to strengthen Arsenal. 

Producer and director, Ben Winston, a season ticket holder at the club for over 30 years, will also join the Board as a Non-Executive Director.  This group will combine with our long-serving Director, Lord Harris of Peckham, to bring diverse experience and knowledge from across finance, sport, retail, property development, media and entertainment to support the club moving forward.

Co-Chair, Josh Kroenke said: “We are delighted to promote Rich to CEO after an incredibly successful period as Managing Director of Arsenal. 

“Rich has made an enormous impact on all fronts as we continue to strive to win major trophies, be financially sustainable and put our supporters at the heart of everything. 

“At this moment, we would like to thank Tim for his continued dedication and commitment to Arsenal in a period of transformational change for the club.  He has played a pivotal role and ensured we are in a great position to continue to deliver our strategy in our ambition to win major trophies.

“In keeping with our desire to always move forward, we will strengthen our Board with some exciting additions who will bring vast experience to the club across a wide range of professions. 

“The group know and love Arsenal, and will bring a different skillset and expertise while injecting fresh thinking and energy to support us all to achieve our ambitions.” 

The appointment of our new Directors is subject to completion of the Premier League’s Owners and Directors Test.",220,73,2025-09-19T08:20:28,https://reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1nkxvhl/arsenal_announce_leadership_and_board_update/,2025-09-20T12:09:25.155724

* Concerns over previous rashness and whether that's changed
* How he projects in possession (build-up, advanced play, crossing, wide work, etc)
* How I see him positionally at Arsenal
* How he fits into the squad-build
* ...much more

1nj591e,post,tottenham,coys,Osiris64,Pedro Porro vs PL Fullbacks," 🇪🇸 Pedro Porro (Tottenham, 2025/26)
📊 vs Premier League Fullbacks

Source: DataMb

If anyone still think Porro cannot defend, they need to see this. Even from the Eye Test, Porro is playing almost like a third CB this season, allowing Spence to go forward a lot, while he drops back. And CBs move to the left. He also seems to link well with Kudus - who also helps out defensively. And while we may miss out Porro screamers, this definitely is helping us loads at the back. You can see why our left side is weak in comparison, but the right is top notch.

nf46j2e,comment,tottenham,coys,beefjesus69,,"Lovely mini-documentary. Like most boys growing up in Sweden I played football (in Gothenburg) and Brommapojkarna is infamous through-out the country of being extremely good and having insane ballers. My club even played against them twice over the years in Gothia Cup, a big youth cup tournament in Gothenburg. The difference in level was absoultely insane. We got trashed both times we played BP.

What is a bit sad is that it's known that many super talented young players that come out of Brommapojkarna never actually make it due to reasons outside of football. Sweden, and especially Stockholm where BP is based out of, is plagued with societal issues and crime. Many talented boys over the years get caught up with youth gangs, drugs or just come from abusive homes.

That's the difference with Lucas. He seems to come from a really good family and that helps a lot. Talent and hard work isn't always enough, home situation and the people around you can make or break a players career  and potential.",72,0,2025-09-19T18:31:00,https://reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1nlakyd/lucas_bergvall_tottenham_midfielders_rise_from/nf46j2e/,2025-09-20T12:11:32.849066

We were an incredibly easy team to beat last year and our attack was shit all the same.  We have some great new signings but the core of the team is still largely the same, and even missing the 2 players that arguably played the biggest part in the attack we had (Madders and Kulu).  Additionally, both Xavi and Kolo Muani need some time to build a chemistry with the rest of the squad.  

I firmly believe the attacking pressure and goals will come, we are just in the middle of a mentality shift from last season because for good reason, we are abandoning the full throttle disregard for defense that dominated our style last season.",65,0,2025-09-17T16:10:46,https://reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1njgok9/tottenham_need_patience_while_their_attack_takes/neq6mak/,2025-09-20T12:11:48.324272
neq3p5i,comment,tottenham,coys,lowercase_0,,I agree patience is needed but I think even Frank admitted the way we attack needs work. We are far too reliant on set pieces and crosses right now and our build up play has me concerned. I trust Frank to figure that out though as players build up fitness and familiarity with eachothers movements and players come back from injury. Personally I'm so excited to see how he uses Kulusevski as I think he can really solve our disjointedness in the final 3rd rn and allow Kudus to float more centrally where they both can alternate positions between eachother.,24,0,2025-09-17T15:56:42,https://reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1njgok9/tottenham_need_patience_while_their_attack_takes/neq3p5i/,2025-09-20T12:11:48.324275

Cuti here, the smiles with Bergvall and such coming off at the weekend, he seems a really down to earth guy, but what I like about him is in his interviews, he speaks with sincerity and a refreshing honesty. Spoke with Sky after the game and he's straight to the point about where we went wrong and he accepts it and doesn't mince his words, so I think most players can appreciate someone who is direct and confident in their analysis, understanding and then direction on how to progress.
